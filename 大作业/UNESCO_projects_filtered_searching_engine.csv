"""One-stop  shop” for the monitoring and assessment of the implementation of standard-setting instruments","At the 217th session of the Executive Board, the CR Committee noted that an IT platform was being developed within CLT to centralize the receipt of reports from Member States on the implementation of standard-setting instruments in the field of culture, with a view to preparing the first world report on cultural policies. As soon as the platform is fully operational within CLT, it can then be rolled out to the other programme sectors, with each sector adapting it where necessary to suit the specific needs of the consultations on the implementation of standard-setting instruments within their areas of expertise. Following this roll-out, a dedicated page will be set up in the section of the Legal Affairs website devoted to the first aspect of the terms of reference of the CR Committee (monitoring of the implementation of UNESCO’s standard-setting instruments), which would direct Member States to a central source of information related to the various consultations under way and provide easy access to each of the relevant platforms, thus constituting a “one-stop shop” for the monitoring of the implementation of standard-setting instruments. Thanks to a generous voluntary contribution from the Government of Switzerland, allocated in December 2023 to LA (96,000 Swiss francs), the CR Committee Secretariat will, at the start of the current budget period 2024-2025, during which four consultations will be initiated, launch a web page that will bring together the necessary information relating to these various consultations, and which will benefit as far as possible from the technical functionalities that will be developed in 2025 when the CLT IT platform is set up and extended to the other programme sectors.","Enabling Outcome 11 - Accountable, efficient and effective management in pursuit of the Organization's results",11.LA1 - The Organization's management and programme implementation in compliance with rules and regulations,OFFICE INTL STANDARDS AND LEGAL AFFAIRS,,,,,2024-01-01,2025-12-31,

Introducing Living Heritage and Cultural Expressions in Gambian Schools to Safeguard the National Inventoried List of Intangible Cultural Heritage,"The Gambia’s culture sector is characterized by diversity and heterogeneity. As Gambia subscribes to most of the UNESCO cultural conventions, this calls for strengthening the safeguarding of both the tangible and intangible aspects of its cultural heritage, including the arts, for a more peaceful and inclusive society. It is pertinent to rally around the country’s cultural diversity as a source of inspiration to galvanize its people for better understanding and mutual respect of each other’s values and traditions. 

Upon ratifying the UNESCO 2003 Convention on the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH), the Government of The Gambia committed to safeguarding ICH elements in its territory. This includes inventorying ICH, raising public awareness about the importance of safeguarding ICH and its contribution to sustainable development, and supporting communities in their efforts to safeguard ICH. To this end, the country has recently inventoried 30 ICH elements in its national list of endangered living heritages. This new initiative augurs very well with the vision of the country to enliven these intangible cultural elements with the younger generations of The Gambia. Some of these elements have both gender and sustainable development connotations and it would be a good drive to engage children and their teacher coordinators in ASPnet and Clubs for UNESCO schools to understand and adapt them into their lives in order to foster the appreciation of Gambian culture and values.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particul",PARTICIPAT.

Effects of Electronic and medical waste on the Environment and Human Health: Engaging Schools and Communities to advocate for a more resilient ecosystem management,"As we sail through the digital age, a new frontier has emerged in the realm of environmental protection—the online sphere. This vast interconnected landscape has become an essential catalyst in propelling discussions about various environmental issues, and medical waste management sits at the forefront of these conversations. According to statistics, of the total waste generated by health-care activities, 15% is considered hazardous material that may be infectious, toxic, or radioactive. Given the tremendous environmental repercussions associated with mishandling medical waste, it is imperative to address this issue head-on. In this project write-up, we will explore the intricate dynamics of medical waste, its environmental impact, the role of technology, existing challenges, and inspirational initiatives that provide a beacon of hope.
Medical waste is a huge environmental issue and according to records, every year, an estimated 16 billion injections are administered worldwide, but not all of the needles and syringes are properly disposed of afterward. Furthermore, the advent of the Covid pandemic has exacerbated the impact of medical waste. As demand for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) – including gloves, masks, and gowns – grew worldwide in response to the Covid-19 outbreak in the last two years, medical waste disposal rates skyrocketed.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are 8 types of medical waste: (Infectious waste, Pathological waste, Sharps waste, Chemical waste, Pharmaceutical waste, Cytotoxic waste, Radioactive waste, Non-hazardous or general waste).

The Covid-19 pandemic was not just a public health crisis, but an environmental crisis, too. An estimated 8 million metric tons of plastics already enter the ocean on an annual basis. According to a report by the World Health Organization, the medical waste accumulated during the pandemic increased plastic pollution in the oceans by 10 times.


On the other hand electrical and electronic devices generating e-waste are from IT and telecommunication equipment and consumer electrical/electronic products such as refrigerators, washing machines, computers and its accessories, brails, mobile phones and chargers, remotes, compact discs, headphones, batteries, LCD/Plasma TVs, i-pods, air conditioners, dryers, fridge, VCRs, stereos, copiers, fax machines, video games, presenters, music system and other household appliances etc. many of which contain toxic materials. It is estimated that about 50 million tonnes of e-waste is generated every year all over the world.

Consequently, as the Gambia is part of the global community, the management of hazardous electric/electronic and medical waste forms part of the major challenges the country is grappling with like many developing countries. Medical and e-waste are major problems posing very significant health and environmental hazards.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particul",PARTICIPAT.

DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE CONTENT MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES AND ENHANCING STAFF CAPACITIES FOR OPTIMAL UTILIZATION OF MOES VIRTUAL INFORMATION CENTRE,"The Ministry of Education and Sports (MoES) in Uganda has made significant strides in enhancing access to a diverse array of educational resources by establishing a digital/Virtual Information Centre (VIC) with support from UNESCO during the last Biennium, serving as a vital platform for disseminating crucial educational resources and information materials to both internal stakeholders within the MoES and the broader public.
Despite the extensive resources available within the centre, their utilization remains significantly below potential. This underutilization is primarily due to the absence of effective content management strategies and insufficient staff capacities among others.
Building upon this foundation, this project aims to develop comprehensive content management strategies, enhance staff capacities and promote the VIC among other stakeholders to maximize the utilization of the MoES Virtual Information Centre (VIC) in Uganda.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particul",PARTICIPAT.

"Capacity building and awareness creation of law enforcement officers on safety of Journalists, freedom of expression and the right to information in Uganda","Media Workers and Law enforcement agencies are often faced with many challenges to balance the rights to freedom of expression with the imperative to maintain impartiality and public order management. During turbulent times, law enforcement agencies have had to manage public safety issues around elections, natural disasters and public health emergencies, and facilitate respect for freedom of expression and the right to peaceful assembly. Political, social and economic circumstances have increasingly encouraged unrest among the public, placing officers in often difficult situations.
Against this backdrop, journalists and their freedom are increasingly threathened. A total of 1,088 journalsist have been killed for their work or while on job within the last 12 years. In the first half of 2022 alone, 45 media professionals have been killed. In response, government and law enforcement agencies have had to examine their ways of dealing with public order issues, working with journalists and communicating effectively with the public.
Despite the fact that media in Uganda has tremendously expanded and that Uganda’s 1995 constitution, the Press and Journalist Act, 1995 and other existing laws guarantee press freedom, so little has been done to promote media rights, safety and improvement of the working climate and conditions . The threats to free expression and access to information still remain in place. Together with the growing influence of business interests on the media, the threats continue to pose major challenges to the campaign for open dialogue, democratic rights and good governance in Uganda.  Concerns of this nature continue to keep human rights defenders in the country on their toes in search for ways to protect and promote open spaces where divergent ideas can flourish to foster democracy.
The Ugandan constitution and other existing laws guarantee press freedom, but the state actors usually ignores them at will. To compound the problem, the rate of impunity for crimes against journalists, media workers and social media producers remains high. Those involved in harassing media are never investigated and prosecuted. It is upon this background that we need as a country to promote press freedom at all level so that the gains realized is not washed away by the State actors.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particul",PARTICIPAT.

PROMOTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND CLIMATE CHANGE EDUCATION IN THE PRIMARY TEACHERS TRAINING CURRICULUM,"The project has been designed to promote integration of environmental education including climate change into the Primary Teachers Training Curriculum in Uganda.  
The approach to implementation of the project will include reviewing the existing Primary Teachers training curriculum for integration of environmental education. The review process will be participatory involving key actors in Teacher Education training and development. Workshops will be organized to assess teaching content including curriculum guides, leaners’ textbooks, examination papers and related materials among others. The review process will also help in determining tentative themes and some of the key actors to be engaged in subsequent stages.  This will be followed by participatory consultations where both physical and virtual media will be utilized and validation of the first report will be undertaken. The consultations and data collection are expected to target pre- service teachers’ learners in Primary Schools, District Education Officers, District Inspectors of Schools, Area Centre Coordinating Tutors, community members and environmental experts, educators including in service teachers, school administrators, curriculum specialists, examiners, education policy makers and related institutions among others. A series of engagements will be organized for data and information generation, validation, reporting and dissemination. The next stage will involve development of the Tutors guide or manual. The Tutors manual or resource book will be a practical support material for Tutors and preservice teachers in Primary Teacher Training Institutions. It will provide basic information on environmental education and Climate Change Mitigation actions in Primary Teachers Training Institutions A training of master trainers will be conducted who in turn will train selected tutors at regional levels to strengthen the capacity of Teacher Educators to promote A training of master trainers will be conducted who in turn will train selected tutors at regional levels to strengthen the capacity of Teacher educators to manage and promote environmental education and Climate Change Mitigation actions in Primary Teachers Training Institutions","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particul",PARTICIPAT.

Bien plus que la vulnérabilité des pays de la zone face à une pluviométrie largement déficitaire et irrégulière, la prise de conscience des enjeux liés à l’eau a progressivement convergé vers un consensus pour une approche innovatrice de gestion des ressources en eau. La Gestion Intégrée des Ressources en Eau (GIRE) est ainsi apparue comme une des approches pour atteindre la bonne gouvernance de l’eau.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particul",PARTICIPAT.

Séminaire – Atelier de contribution à une stratégie nationale de promotion et développement du Handisport au Gabon,"Le sport de masse est un puissant instrument pour promouvoir l’inclusion et rassembler les gens. Lorsqu’il est ciblé et fondé sur des valeurs et une éducation physique de qualité, il peut avoir un impact positif sur la vie des personnes, en particulier celles se trouvant dans des situations vulnérables, telles que les personnes en situation de handicap. 
Créée en 1976, la Conférence Internationale des Ministres et Hauts Fonctionnaires responsables de l&#39;Education Physique et du Sport (MINEPS) est un forum qui facilite l’échange intellectuel et technique en matière d’éducation physique et de sport. Au terme de sa Septième (7e) Conférence internationale (MINEPS VII), organisée à Bakou (République d&#39;Azerbaïdjan) du 26 au 29 juin 2023, les Etats membres ont encore donné au sport la place qui lui revient dans l&#39;agenda international par l’adoption de l’Alliance Fit4Life « en forme pour la vie ».
« En forme pour la vie » est programme basé sur le sport et conçu pour soutenir et améliorer  l’élaboration de politiques inclusives et intégrés de la pratique du sport comme facteur d’épanouissement des populations et de transformation. 
Au Gabon, du fait de sa nature, le Comité Intergouvernemental pour l’Education Physique et le Sport (CIGEPS) de la Commission Nationale Gabonaise pour l’UNESCO, a le potentiel pour engager le gouvernement gabonais dans un effort national coordonné pour optimiser les bénéfices socio-économiques tangibles des programmes de sport et d’éducation physique, et de défendre des investissements intelligents dans le sport pour un développement durable dans le cadre global du Programme à l’horizon 2030.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particul",PARTICIPAT.

En Afrique, et particulièrement au Gabon, la compréhension, l’image, la bonne gouvernance de l&#39;IA restent encore des défis importants de notre époque. Cela un apprentissage mutuel basé sur les leçons et les bonnes pratiques émergeant des différentes juridictions à travers le monde, en respectant les normes et standards mondiaux, et en étant ancrée dans la paix pour un développement durable. Madame Audrey Azoulay, Directrice Générale de l’UNESCO, soulignait encore à ce propos lors de la 41ème session de la Conférence générale que : « L’intelligence artificielle peut être une chance formidable pour accélérer la réalisation des objectifs de développement durable. Mais toute révolution technologique entraîne de nouveaux déséquilibres qu’il faut essayer d’anticiper ».

Workshop on Climate Change and Sustainable Development,"Despite efforts to promote sustainable development, Liberia remains highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The country’s long coastline and reliance on agriculture make it particularly susceptible to sea-level rise, storm surges, and changing rainfall patterns. These impacts pose significant challenges to the country’s development goals, including efforts to reduce poverty and promote economic growth. Moreover, it is proven that Liberia is facing numerous challenges related to climate change and sustainable development, including increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events, deforestation, and limited access to clean water and energy, there is a lack of widespread awareness and capacity at the community level to address these issues effectively. Communities often lack the knowledge, resources, and support needed to develop and implement climate-resilient strategies and sustainable development practices. Additionally, there may be a disconnection between national policies and local priorities, hindering coordinated action at the grassroots level. Consequently, there is an urgent need to empower communities with the tools, information, and skills necessary to adapt to climate change, mitigate its impacts, and promote sustainable development practices that enhance resilience and improve livelihoods across Liberia.
To address some of these challenges, there is a need to build climate resilience and promote sustainable development at the community level. Community-based strategies can help to ensure that interventions are tailored to local needs and realities, while also empowering communities to take action to adapt to climate change and build resilience. However, there are significant barriers to implementing such strategies in Liberia, including limited resources, capacity gaps, and a lack of awareness and understanding of climate change issues among communities.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particul",PARTICIPAT.

TOT Workshops on the Preventions and Awareness of HIV/AIDS and Coronavirus for ASPnet Students and UNESCO Club Members,"Since there is no cure for either HIV/AIDS or coronavirus, preventive and awareness information should always be made available . Despite the information that there have been efforts to address HIV &amp; AIDS and Coronavirus awareness in Liberia, there is a critical need for targeted interventions among ASPnet Students and UNESCO Club Members. These groups may lack comprehensive knowledge about preventive measures, transmission modes, and the importance of early detection for both HIV &amp; AIDS and Coronavirus. Additionally, socio-cultural factors, stigma, and misinformation may contribute to the vulnerability of these populations. The overlapping risks and preventive strategies for HIV &amp; AIDS and Coronavirus further emphasize the importance of a combined awareness workshop. Therefore, there is an urgent need to conduct workshops that specifically target ASPnet Students and UNESCO Club Members, providing them with accurate information, dispelling myths, and empowering them with the knowledge and skills necessary to protect themselves and their communities from both HIV &amp; AIDS and Coronavirus. Moreover, HIV &amp; AIDS and Coronavirus Prevention and Awareness Workshops for ASPnet Students and UNESCO Club Members in Liberia would typically outline the key issues that the workshop aims to address. In this case, the workshop would focus on highlighting the challenges and gaps in knowledge or awareness regarding HIV &amp; AIDS and coronavirus among ASPnet students and UNESCO club members in Liberia. It would emphasize the importance of conducting a workshop to educate and raise awareness among these groups about prevention strategies, transmission modes, stigma reduction, and overall public health implications of these diseases.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particul",PARTICIPAT.

Promoting Reading Society in Liberia through National Book Fairs,"Despite the recognized benefits of fostering a culture of reading, Liberia faces challenges in promoting and sustaining a vibrant reading society. Factors such as limited access to diverse and affordable reading materials, low reading engagement levels, and a lack of community-based initiatives contribute to a diminished reading culture among the population. The absence of platforms like book fairs hinders the promotion of literacy, critical thinking, and intellectual growth. This gap not only affects individual development but also has broader implications for education, social cohesion, and cultural enrichment. Therefore, there is a pressing need to organize and promote book fairs as a means to encourage reading, improve access to a variety of literature, and cultivate a thriving reading society in Liberia. Moreover, Promoting Reading Society through Book Fairs in Liberia” revolves around the need to address the low literacy rates and lack of reading culture in Liberia. The objective is to promote a reading society by utilizing book fairs as a platform to engage the community, especially children and youth, in reading activities. This initiative aims to foster a culture of literacy, improve access to books, and encourage a love for reading among Liberians.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particul",PARTICIPAT.

Fossil and Stratigraphy Identification to study on Paleo-environment of Sount-west Cambodia,"In the wake of an extraordinary milestone in Cambodia&#39;s scientific narrative, the discovery and publication of the country&#39;s inaugural dinosaur fossil. this proposal, titled Fossil and Stratigraphy Identification to study on Paleo-environment of Sount-west Cambodia takes center stage. The preliminary study conducted by the Department of Heritage Park, the General Department of the local Community,  Ministry of Environment of Cambodia, unveils a fascinating revelation. Between the years 2019 and 2023, 59 fossil-rich locations have been identified in Banteay Meanchey, Battambang, Koh Kong, Strung Treng, Ratanakiri, Prah Vihear, Posat, and Siem Reap Provinces, as reported in the department&#39;s preliminary findings).

These identified locations boast a diverse array of fossil types, ranging from marine fossils to petrified woods, enigmatic footprints etched in time, and dinosaur skeletons that have been published in MPDI as international articles of fossil studies. The significance of this discovery reverberates through Cambodia&#39;s natural landscape, urging us to embark on an ambitious journey of exploration and identification.

Despite the richness of these fossil sites in Koh Kong and Kompot provinces, the details surrounding the fossils, biostratigraphy, and paleontology remain largely undocumented. The preliminary study underscores a critical gap in our understanding, primarily attributed to a lack of expertise and specialized equipment. In response, this proposal seeks to address and bridge these gaps, propelling Cambodia into a new era of scientific exploration and documentation.

Through meticulous identification, study, and documentation of these fossils, we aim to elevate Cambodia&#39;s standing in the global paleontological community. Furthermore, by nominating key fossil-rich sites for consideration on the UNESCO Global Geopark and /or World Heritage List for  Natural Heritage, Cambodia aspires to not only safeguard its paleontological treasures but also to contribute invaluable insights to the broader understanding of Earth&#39;s ancient history.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particul",PARTICIPAT.

Strengthening Legal Education and Institutional Capacity through the Development of an Internal Quality Assurance Framework at JSW Law,"Established in February 2015 under a Royal Charter, Jigme Singye Wangchuck School of Law (JSW Law) is Bhutan&#39;s first and only law school, embodying the vision of His Majesty the King and the legacy of  &#39;Justice, Service, Wisdom.&#39; The school, led by Her Royal Highness, Princess Sonam Dechan Wangchuck, has become a pioneer in legal education with a unique five-year Bachelor of Law/Postgraduate Diploma in National Law program. JSW Law actively contributes to Bhutan&#39;s Social Development Plan, particularly focusing on Outcome 2: &quot;More Bhutanese equitably access and benefit from quality and wholesome education and lifelong learning by 2029.&quot; Aligned with national goals and UNESCO&#39;s mission for quality education and recognizing the importance of a dynamic education system, JSW Law envisions integrating a robust Internal Quality Assurance (IQA) framework across its operations to ensure quality, relevance, and responsiveness. 

Despite commendable achievements within a short period of its establishment, His Majesty emphasized the need for expansion beyond the LL.B./PGDNL, urging JSW Law to broaden its focus. In terms of Quality Assurance, JSW Law faces a few challenges that hinder the establishment of a robust IQA framework. One significant challenge is the lack of expertise in IQA within the institution. As a relatively young and pioneering law school in Bhutan, JSW Law does not have a dedicated pool of professionals with specialized knowledge in quality assurance processes. This shortage of expertise poses a significant challenge in developing and implementing an effective IQA mechanism. Furthermore, the institution is confronted with financial constraints inherent to its developmental phase. The lack of budget limits the school’s capacity to invest in training, technology, and other resources necessary for the successful implementation of a comprehensive IQA framework. Addressing these challenges is crucial for JSW Law to continue advancing its vision and mission, ensuring the sustained delivery of high-quality legal education in Bhutan. 

Recognizing the critical role of Internal Quality Assurance in maintaining and enhancing educational standards, this proposal seeks to establish a comprehensive Internal Quality Assurance mechanism at JSW Law. Additionally, it proposes a targeted capacity-building initiative tailored for JSW Law to develop and implement a robust IQA framework.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particul",PARTICIPAT.

Three Day Workshop on Cultural (and National Heritage) Policy   Development,"The idea of the preservation of natural and cultural heritage has entered into the international arena with the adoption of the ‘Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage in 1972. This convention was introduced considering the global context that disturbs or harms the cultural and natural heritages in the world. Therefore, this proposed project will cover the subject area that was emphasized by the 1972 convention. 
Even Though government has paid more attention to the culture and heritage sector, absence of a national policy for culture and heritage to ensure the long-lasting safeguard of the sector is a critical issue. Hence, the main objective of the proposed project is to to develop a national policy for the Cultural and National Heritage sector in Sri Lanka through a residential workshop. 
Since the culture and heritage are a very sensitive and dynamic area, policy preparation to satisfy all stakeholders is a challenge. Therefore, this workshop will be designed as a three-day residential workshop and includes consultation sessions with the participation of relevant stakeholders in the public sector, private sector and NGO sector. It is expected to have around 40 participants for the workshop.

Lesotho, facing potential cultural appropriation, aims to capitalize on its diverse cultural heritage for economic development through Creative Cultural Industries (CCI). While Lesotho has been active in fashion, there&#39;s a need to enhance participation in music, film, and food systems. The project focuses on learning and capacity building to promote entrepreneurship, cultural appreciation, and global market positioning. Lessons from a film production project underscore the gender disparities in powerful positions within CCI, especially in the film industry.

Campagne de sensibilisation sur les opportunités de la Réserve de Biosphère de Sena Oura à Pala au Mayo Kebbi,"5.	 (a) Présentation succincte du projet
Grâce à une gouvernance ouverte entre la République du Tchad et l’UNESCO, la réserve de biosphère de Sena-Oura a été créée et est la première réserve de biosphère du Tchad. Elle couvre une surface totale de 173 520 ha constituant les derniers vestiges intacts de la savane soudanaise du pays et abrite des éléphants, des Elans de Derby et des girafes. Grâce à la profusion de terres fertiles et aux conditions agro climatiques favorables, l’agriculture traditionnelle et l’élevage du bétail en particulier assurent la subsistance de près de 90 % de la population. La sylviculture joue également un rôle important dans l’économie locale, avec la production de produits très prisés comme le miel et l’huile de karité.
Afin de reconnaître le rôle majeur que jouent les réserves de biosphère pour l’ensemble de la zone de Sena-Oura, l’Association des Jeunes pour l’Assainissement et la Protection de l’Environnement (AJAPE), une ONG nationale partenaire à l’UNESCO en collaboration avec le Ministère de l’Environnement, de la Pêche et du Développement Durable compte organiser des campagnes d’information et de sensibilisation, en faveur des populations (jeunes, femmes, chefs de village, chefs de canton, autorités locales…). La date précise de cette manifestation est programmée du 12 au 20 juin 2024 à Pala.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particul",PARTICIPAT.

"Projet de renforcement des capacités des radios communautaires des régions frontalières avec les pays en conflit (Soudan, Lybie, RCA, Bassin du Lac-Tchad)","(a) Présentation succincte du projet
Les radios communautaires jouent un rôle déterminant dans le maintien de la paix au Tchad. En effet, elles produisent et diffusent des émissions sur la paix et le vivre ensemble dans les différentes régions du pays, apportant ainsi une contribution importante à la lutte contre l’extrémisme violent et participant à la recherche des solutions pour une paix durable, notamment dans les régions en proie aux attaques de Boko-Haram ou dans les régions en crise.
Il se trouve malheureusement que ces médias qui sont généralement créés par des missionnaires ou des ONG nationales, sont pour certaines, gérés par les communautés elles-mêmes, parfois bénévolement et sans expérience technique. Ce sont souvent les jeunes sans emploi qui sont recrutés sans formation préalable.
C’est pourquoi, les défis auxquels ces radios sont confrontées sont généralement ceux de l’insuffisance de formation dans de nombreux domaines allant de la gestion d’une radio communautaire aux problèmes de maintenance des émetteurs ou de l’animation. Des radios communautaires des régions sensibles sont ainsi ciblées dans le cadre de ce projet.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particul",PARTICIPAT.

"Entrepreneurship Empowering young men, girls and students to participate in entrepreneurship using communications and information technology in the modern era, and to contribute to achieving sustainable development goals.","Introduction
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) gives great attention to building a society of knowledge and information, inclusive of all, to achieve sustainable development, innovation and leadership in the use of communication and information technology for the purposes of education and entrepreneurship, and ensuring that everyone’s equal participation in the development of society is an essential factor in achieving: 
	The fourth goal of sustainable development, which is related to the quality of education, 
	The fifth goal, which considers gender equality, 
	The ninth goal, which relates to industry and innovation; by strengthening industry and innovation, new economic opportunities can be provided, and increase and speed of access to sources of information and technology can be available, which enhances economic development and contributes to protection of fundamental freedoms.
	The tenth goal, which relates to alleviating gaps in societies and between countries, 
	The seventeenth goal, which relates to partnerships to achieve the goals. 

This aims to enhance international cooperation and partnerships between the public and private sectors and civil society, to achieve the goals of sustainable development, including the protection of freedoms, and providing access to information for all. This is to enhance the capabilities of young people, achieve the principle of universal access to information, and provide opportunities for comprehensive, equitable quality education and lifelong learning for all, and for the different marginalized and vulnerable groups (women, girls, youth, and people with special needs).
The progress achieved in the field of communications and information technology and the increasing interconnectedness between the societies of knowledge will enhance work to advance innovation, entrepreneurship, renovation, and creating new job opportunities for youth, women, and girls to improve the standard of their living and income. Open resources programs of information and technology provide the opportunity to support and empower developing countries and all individuals and society. They also ensures social and economic inclusion for all, which contributes to achieving sustainable development goals and reducing the percentage of young people deprived of jobs, education or training opportunities.
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has a major role in enhancing the effective contribution of women and girls in the field of using communication and information technology in the fields of education, science and culture. Due to people’s increasing reliance on digital technological means, the use of social media creates opportunities of work for young people, and at the same time creates great challenges. Opportunities that can be seized in this regard include social learning, innovation, knowledge exchange, democratic participation, and intercultural dialogue. One of the most important challenges that must be addressed is the spread of misinformation and widespread disinformation, which directly affects young people as the main users of the internet and social media globally.
Through this project, the Egyptian National Committee, as a link between the UNESCO and the concerned parties, will contribute to building an inclusive society of knowledge and information to achieve sustainable development by creating a specialized training package in entrepreneurship and making good use of modern technology and artificial intelligence tools to qualify young people for the labor market and increase their capabilities for compete globally.
Through this project, the Egyptian National Committee will provide partnerships and cooperation between:

1. Educational institutions and teachers who play an essential role in enhancing media and information literacy among learners and enabling them to acquire the necessary competencies to participate in the digital field as global citizens. It will take place at all levels of primary and secondary education, as well as in the field of adult learning.
2. Youth organizations, young people and especially young women; young people are the most active users of digital technologies, therefore it is necessary to ensure that they acquire the necessary digital competencies in the field of media and information literacy, and to ensure their ability to have effective entrepreneurship that enables them to create the desired impact to face the challenges related to the development of this field. So, the necessary measures will be taken to achieve the following:
•	Enabling young people to acquire competencies in the field of media, information literacy and digital competencies and using them as peer educators
•	Enhancing the capacity of youth-led organizations to integrate media and information literacy into their activities, policies and strategies through means that include encouraging intercultural dialogue to achieve understanding;
•	Supporting effective youth actions that enable young people to find the necessary solutions and play an active role as they are able to bring about the desired change in order to achieve social inclusion and combat all forms of exclusion, racism and discrimination in the digital field;
•	Assuring that young people’s use of digital technologies, and the impact of these means on them is part and parcel of comprehensive youth development approaches in youth policies;
•	Enhancing science-based youth organizations to have the desired impact in decision-making processes;
•	Relying on advances and developments in the field of neurotechnology to find solutions to serious mental health problems.

3. Media institutions and media workers; by establishing partnerships with digital communications platforms as principal actors to integrate media and information literacy in digital spaces.
Working with the above-mentioned groups, the necessary links will be created between them to put relevant tools on digital learning and guidelines on digital citizenship into practice. This is to cope with UNESCO’s endeavors to take gender equality into account as one of its main areas of focus, while recognizing the digital gap that exists between men and women, which prevents women and girls from benefiting from digital technology and participating in the digital field through engaging men and boys as responsible allies to advance gender equality in the digital sphere.

This will help the concerned authorities integrate in providing overall solutions for young people to confront economic conditions, and benefit from information, open source software, and modern artificial intelligence tools, and harness digital technological means to build peace and achieve sustainable development and build inclusive knowledge societies, through the use of open solutions (open educational resources, open access and open data);
This project enhances the contribution to the Information for All program and contributes to the endeavors aimed at achieving the two goals; universal access to information and inclusion of all in the digital era.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particul",PARTICIPAT.

Improving Literacy and Numeracy at the Kindergarten Level,"Division of Public Education’s focus is to strengthen the quality of the education that we offer to our students. In doing so, it is the intention to focus on the earlier age groups specifically the kindergarten year 1 and 2 classes. This is where formal education begins for most children entering the public schools, as most of the students who are enrolled in Public Education do not attend preschool (1-3 years).  Our kindergarten classes begin with the kindergarten 1- or the 4-year old’s and then the student moves on into the second year of kindergarten, or the 5- years old’s.  

The focus is to restructure the teaching instruction for this group. In doing, so it is essential to have the early childhood material which will allow the teachers to work more effectively with these students.  The expectation is not only to see that the students are academically ready, but to also see that they have developed socially and emotionally as well. Therefore, the early childhood materials purchased must be aligned with the learning standards and teaching objectives of our curriculum.  The materials should reflect diverse backgrounds, and the learning styles of students.  It is the belief that the students will be successful learners in the long run because a solid foundation for learning has been developed for these young children. 

Research shows that high-quality learning resources can boost student engagement, motivation, and comprehension.  Research also shows that if kindergarten children can explore while learning during play, it helps to stimulate their creativity and higher thinking skills.  They will not be passive learners but will be actively engaged in their daily learning activities. This is what we would like to achieve with our students. We are hoping that with this grant we can enhance our kindergarten classrooms and make them more conducive for learning.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particul",PARTICIPAT.

Promouvoir la culture de l’anticipation avec les communautés scolaire et universitaire de la ville de Bouaké par l’éducation prospective,"Il est courant d’entendre les gouvernants dire que l’avenir des Etats appartient à la jeunesse. Cette réalité est encore plus vivante en Afrique où la jeunesse représente, selon de nombreuses recherches menées sur le dividende démographique, environ 60 % de la population totale du continent (PNUD, 2023). De ce fait, l’Afrique est un continent avec une population essentiellement jeune qui pourrait stimuler le développement économique. Elle est la principale force active et éduquée de la population. Et pourtant, cette jeunesse se trouve plutôt apeurée par son avenir en raison des tendances actuelles qui n’augurent point d’un futur radieux. Si cette situation a des facteurs explicatifs liés à l’efficacité des politiques publiques dédiées à la jeunesse, elle est aussi liée au fait que cette jeunesse ne dispose pas toujours des rudiments nécessaires pour explorer son avenir, le lire et se projeter raisonnablement dans le futur souhaité. Cet état de fait a pour incidence, tant à l’échelle personnelle que nationale, d’empêcher, d’inhiber voire de détruire le potentiel d’innovation et d’imagination de cette jeunesse qui est censée être au cœur du développement des nations. Dans la ville de Bouaké, en Côte d’Ivoire, cette situation est d’actualité et soutenue par un taux d’analphabétisme estimé à 43% (Mairie de Bouaké, 2023) et 54,9% de taux de chômage (INS, ENV 2015). 

En vue de créer donc un cadre exploratoire de compréhension du futur, la Chaire UNESCO Anticipation, Prospective et Territoires Durables de l’Université Alassane OUATTARA initie le projet « Promouvoir la culture de l’anticipation avec les communautés scolaire et universitaire de la ville de Bouaké par l’éducation prospective» dans le but d’expérimenter l’éducation prospective dans les établissements scolaires et universitaires de la ville de Bouaké afin de promouvoir la culture de l’anticipation auprès de la jeunesse pour la rendre plus créatrice et prospective. Ce projet s’inscrit dans le cadre de l’ODD 4 « Education de qualité » visant à faire en sorte que tous puissent suivre une éducation de qualité dans des conditions d’équité et promouvoir les opportunités d’apprentissage tout au long de la vie.  

Pour des sociétés résilientes et inclusives, il convient de mettre les outils de la prospective à la disposition de tous. Ce projet vise à démocratiser la prospective de sorte à amener les communautés scolaire et universitaire à être lettré du futur en réactivant en elles le pouvoir de l’imagination dans ces moments d’incertitudes. Il ne s’agit plus de faire de la prospective une chasse gardée de l’élite là où l’urgence bat son plein au sein des communautés. Il s’agit de susciter une mobilisation collective pour une meilleure inclusivité de la prospective en préparant les esprits aux changements. Ce projet entend faire de l’imagination, un puissant outil de co-construction et de mobilisation collective des avenirs des communautés scolaire et universitaire de Bouaké.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particularly in Africa, developing countries, LDCs, and SIDS",PARTICIPAT.

Pour ce faire, il y a lieu de juguler les disparités de genre qui touchent particulièrement l’analphabétisme, la vulnérabilité et la discrimination de la jeune fille. Ce sont les défis visés par l’Organisation porteuse de ce projet.

World Space Day Celebration Week,"World Space Week has been officially declared by the United Nations as the annual week from 4 to 10 October. It is an international celebration of the contribution of space science and technology to improving the human condition. The dates that mark World Space Week commemorate landmark events of the space age: on 4 October 1957, Sputnik I, the first man-made Earth satellite, was launched. The Treaty on the Peaceful Exploration of Outer Space was signed by UN member states on 10 October 1967.
The celebration of World Space Week is an excellent opportunity to highlight the achievements and potential of space exploration on a global level. World Space Week usually takes place in October and involves a variety of activities, including talks, workshops, exhibitions, competitions and much more.
On 4 October 1957, the launch into outer space of the first man-made Earth satellite, Sputnik 1, paved the way for space exploration. A decade later, on 10 October 1967, the Treaty on the Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies entered into force.
Space science and technology and their applications are increasingly being used to support a wide range of United Nations activities. At least 25 United Nations entities and the World Bank Group routinely use space applications. They make important and sometimes essential contributions to the work of the United Nations, including in implementing the recommendations of major world conferences and the Third United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNISPACE III), as well as in supporting sustainable development.
Since the dawn of the Space Age, the United Nations has recognised that outer space has added a new dimension to humanity&#39;s existence. The United Nations family continually strives to utilise the unique benefits of outer space for the betterment of all humanity.
Recognising humanity&#39;s common interest in outer space and seeking to answer questions about how outer space can help benefit the peoples of the Earth, the General Assembly adopted its first resolution related to outer space, resolution 1348 (XIII) entitled &quot;Question of the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space&quot;.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particul",PARTICIPAT.

"Zero violence and no bullying"" project with awareness campaigns and school sports","The human mind is a complex system of interacting processes that generate, encode, transform, and manipulate information of various kinds. According to Almeida (1988), reasoning is associated with concepts such as intelligence, problem solving, and comprehension/thinking. It can be considered a cognitive valence, especially when approached in the discovery of relationships, comparison of elements and choice of alternatives among the answers.

In a game of chess, the use of reasoning is paramount to make well-defined moves. Vygotsky (1998) states that, &quot;although in the game of chess there is no direct substitution for real-life relations, it is undoubtedly a type of imaginary situation&quot;. By learning chess, the student would be developing socially available skills and knowledge, being able to contribute to their self-esteem, that is, without understanding there is no understanding and without understanding there is no learning. 

It should be noted that the game of chess is a form of playful-educational entertainment capable of developing in children and young people the ability to concentrate, memory, judgment, imagination, anticipation, will win, patience, self-control, decision-making, mathematical logic, creativity and intelligence. 

The actions were elaborated in a collaborative and inclusive perspective, which constitute one of the typical principles of UNESCO and by their nature can be an important option to ensure the integration of school activities in times of social isolation and can be used as a way to form values such as respect for differences, non-discrimination and bullying, the reduction of school dropouts and the identification of talents.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particularly in Africa, developing countries, LDCs, and SIDS",PARTICIPAT.

"6th National Meeting of Schools Associated with UNESCO ""Education for Development: Sustainability at School""","The world today lacks committed people who contribute to the well-being of all and the achievement of sustainable development. This change can be driven by education, as it sensitizes, raises awareness, and shapes behaviours.

The pursuit of sustainable development requires the involvement of school managers, teachers, and families for the materialization of the SDGs and, especially, in the exercise of the right to quality education. It should be noted that Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) is recognized in the SDGs of the UN 2030 Agenda as part of target 4.7 of SDG 4, when it expresses that by 2030: 

ensure that all students acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to promote sustainable development, including but not limited to through education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles, human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture of peace and non-violence, global citizenship, and appreciation of cultural diversity and culture&#39;s contribution to sustainable development.&quot; (UNITED NATIONS, 2015).

In Angola, the regulations that govern the Education and Teaching System, within its purposes, guarantee &quot;To train an individual capable of understanding national, regional and international problems in a critical, constructive and innovative way for their active participation in society, (...)&quot;, (LBSEE, 17/16, article no. 4, paragraph c), which demonstrates the social responsibility and commitment that Educational Institutions have with the development of current and future generations.

"Fortalecimiento de las habilidades de educadores y educadoras de la EPJA. Hacia la  circulación social, la participación igualitaria y la cultura: la ciudad como ambiente de  aprendizaje","El proyecto se propone difundir y sensibilizar en el país la importancia de la Educación de 
Personas Jóvenes y Adultas (EPJA) de acuerdo a la definición aprobada en la Recomendación 
sobre el Aprendizaje y la Educación de Adultos, Conferencia General de la UNESCO, Reunión 38ª 
Adoptada el 13 de noviembre de 2015 y las orientaciones acordadas en la VII Conferencia 
Internacional de Educación de Adultos (CONFINTEA) en el Marco de Acción de Marrakech:
“Aprovechar el poder transformador del aprendizaje y la educación de adultos” el Objetivo de 
Desarrollo Sustentable 4: “Garantizar una educación inclusiva, equitativa y de calidad y promover 
oportunidades de aprendizaje durante toda la vida para todos”, contemplado en la Agenda 2030 
de Naciones Unidas.
En este sentido, a partir de estos contenidos fundamentales, se procurará adecuarlos a las 
necesidades e intereses de los diferentes territorios del país, donde trabajan educadoras y 
educadores, en un país donde no se cuenta con una formación específica en EPJA.
Por lo tanto, es necesario, entonces relevar el estado de situaciones particulares a tener en cuenta 
en el diseño de los diferentes módulos que integran el ciclo formativo.
Se prestará especial atención a quienes trabajan:
- en la enseñanza de las personas que no han culminado la enseñanza primaria y media; 
- con mujeres, especialmente aquellas que cursen o desean cursar formación técnica, profesional 
y superior;
- con personas jóvenes, adultas y adultas mayores, especialmente quienes desean adquirir 
competencias técnicas y profesionales, para acceder al empleo, el trabajo decente y el 
emprendedurismo;
- con personas que se encuentran en situación de vulnerabilidad.
Se relevará, sistematizará y dará respuestas a las demandas formativas de colectivos locales del 
interior del país, a través del desarrollo de acciones formativas en educación ciudadana para 
educadores/as, atendiendo a las dificultades de las personas jóvenes y adultas de esa región para 
acceder y sostener aprendizajes más allá del sistema formal de educación, donde los grupos 
postergados y vulnerables, en particular, mujeres y jóvenes, son los más afectados. 
Para responder a estas necesidades se elaborará y ofrecerá, en este primer año y con la 
posibilidad de ser reeditado en el futuro, una propuesta de educación virtual de alcance nacional, 
focalizada en los contenidos que ha sistematizado la Cátedra UNESCO EPJA en Uruguay 
teniendo en cuenta metodologías emergentes en el relevamiento de necesidades. El ciclo

"Public Relations Project for Promoting Gender Equality among Hight School Youth in Bangkok, Thailand","Currently, the situation of gender equality in Thai society has been improving. However, challenges related to gender-based practices and sexual violence persist. Rapid dissemination of information through technological advancements exacerbates these issues. Media also significantly influences shaping thoughts and beliefs, potentially leading to biased expressions of gender-related behaviors/sexual practices, particularly cyberbullying. According to the Department of Mental Health, Thailand ranked second globally in cyberbullying in 2020, following Japan. Survey results indicate that over 91% of youth have experienced cyberbullying, with 43% considering retaliation, posing an increased risk of escalating issues.
Our project team has prior experience receiving funding from the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security, Thailand, to conduct activities promoting gender equality in 2023. To address and prevent future issues, it is essential to raise awareness and understanding of non-gender-based practices and promote gender equality among the youth in Bangkok. This includes respecting others&#39; rights, knowing how to address problems, protecting mental and physical well-being, and being able to adapt and live happily in a collaborative society.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particularly in Africa, developing countries, LDCs, and SIDS",PARTICIPAT.

Strengthening Legal Education and Institutional Capacity through the Development of an Internal Quality Assurance Framework at JSW Law,"Established in February 2015 under a Royal Charter, Jigme Singye Wangchuck School of Law (JSW Law) is Bhutan&#39;s first and only law school, embodying the vision of His Majesty the King and the legacy of  &#39;Justice, Service, Wisdom.&#39; The school, led by Her Royal Highness, Princess Sonam Dechan Wangchuck, has become a pioneer in legal education with a unique five-year Bachelor of Law/Postgraduate Diploma in National Law program. JSW Law actively contributes to Bhutan&#39;s Social Development Plan, particularly focusing on Outcome 2: &quot;More Bhutanese equitably access and benefit from quality and wholesome education and lifelong learning by 2029.&quot; Aligned with national goals and UNESCO&#39;s mission for quality education and recognizing the importance of a dynamic education system, JSW Law envisions integrating a robust Internal Quality Assurance (IQA) framework across its operations to ensure quality, relevance, and responsiveness. 

Despite commendable achievements within a short period of its establishment, His Majesty emphasized the need for expansion beyond the LL.B./PGDNL, urging JSW Law to broaden its focus. In terms of Quality Assurance, JSW Law faces a few challenges that hinder the establishment of a robust IQA framework. One significant challenge is the lack of expertise in IQA within the institution. As a relatively young and pioneering law school in Bhutan, JSW Law does not have a dedicated pool of professionals with specialized knowledge in quality assurance processes. This shortage of expertise poses a significant challenge in developing and implementing an effective IQA mechanism. Furthermore, the institution is confronted with financial constraints inherent to its developmental phase. The lack of budget limits the school’s capacity to invest in training, technology, and other resources necessary for the successful implementation of a comprehensive IQA framework. Addressing these challenges is crucial for JSW Law to continue advancing its vision and mission, ensuring the sustained delivery of high-quality legal education in Bhutan. 

Recognizing the critical role of Internal Quality Assurance in maintaining and enhancing educational standards, this proposal seeks to establish a comprehensive Internal Quality Assurance mechanism at JSW Law. Additionally, it proposes a targeted capacity-building initiative tailored for JSW Law to develop and implement a robust IQA framework.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particularly in Africa, developing countries, LDCs, and SIDS",PARTICIPAT.

Additionally, the Ministry of Health has highlighted a rise in mental health issues among school youth and the prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs).
While the Scouts and Sports Division continues to promote sports and physical activities, it has been observed that not all children have access to sports due to a lack of resources and sports infrastructure. Therefore, there is a pressing need to focus on non-traditional sports (free play), which are easy to organise, inexpensive, and beneficial to child development and education.

"Promote Ecosystem Approaches and Collaborative Natural Resource Management for Climate Change Adaptation in disaster-prone, high-risk and UNESCO-designated sites in Uganda.","Whereas Uganda Government has put in place a legislation called the Uganda wildlife Act 2019 to provide for the conservation and sustainable management of wildlife and streamlining the roles and responsibilities of institutions involved in wildlife conservation and management and for related matters, this law does not make any provisions, let alone mention, the Biosphere Reserves and other globally-designated sites anywhere in the document.  This unfortunate lack of domestication of the MAB principles in the law in the case of the  Biosphere Reserves  means that the principles  of MAB as a scientific Programme for promoting scientific research on human populations’ interaction with ecosystems, the cooperation between all the scientific disciplines to better understand human-nature interactions through science, through education, through training and through building capacities of communities in a Biosphere Reserve setting is not actively promoted.   

 While Section 32 of the Act provides for “Historic rights of communities around conservation areas”, the rights so granted are subject to the guidelines to be provided by the Authority like access to resources which are historically crucial to the survival of those communities. This conditional provision for the indigenous communities who are historically part and parcel of the ecosystem is however different from the Biosphere Reserve management which calls for coexistence between the community and the ecosystem in a consultatively zoned areas designated for the purposes as defined in the MAB Principles. The drive of MAB to overcome conflicts between people’s livelihoods and nature through a “rational” use of natural resources, to establish or re-establish “harmony” between people and their environment is missed out and this has made  it easy to alienate the indigenous communities in these sites from their natural environment. The conflicts between the management of these sites with the indigenous communities have continued due to the, management of these sites without the application of the Biosphere Reserve principles. Although a MAB National Committees exists, the lack of provision for them in the Law governing these protected areas makes it difficult for them to exercise the roles laid down in the MAB Strategy and the WNBR. The same problem exists with the other globally-important sites designated under UNESCO like the 4 World Heritage Sites in the Country. 

 
There are continuing complaints of communities about unfairness in the policies regulating the Biosphere Reserves as punishment is meted out to them when they enter into what should be buffer zones in the Biosphere reserves.  Whereas the communities have complaints of hostility of UWA Officials and Game Rangers towards them (See the Monitor Newspaper January 30th 2024, story below), the UWA Officials also complain of intransigence of the communities, and political interference by the leaders of the communities in the Biosphere reserves. The conservation agency counter-accused the Communities of killing 15 of its staff (rangers) and injuring 35 others between 2002 to 2023. The other BR, Queen Elizabeth, has also experience intermittent conflicts between pastoralists and the conservation managers. 

Other problems associated with land use include the emerging accounts of how nomadic pastoralists called “Balaalo” have migrated to areas of other communities resulting to conflicts in those areas. Such accounts not only depict images of pastoralism as being an outmoded and inefficient livelihood system but also pastoralists as people who are understood almost exclusively through discourses of conflict, insecurity and lawlessness, amongst others. This can potentially contribute to cycles of violence by manipulation of pastoralists against themselves and other local communities. There are also fears of spread of livestock diseases resulting to epidemic in the new areas being migrated to. Some of the encroachments have been to the protected areas of National Forestry Authority. However, all these point to the lack of knowledge appropriate land use practices for climate action, biodiversity, water management and disaster risk reduction (Outcome 3) resulting from non-inclusive development in the country where certain communities have remained excluded from knowledge and skills in  sustainable management of natural resources and disaster risk resilience.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particularly in Africa, developing countries, LDCs, and SIDS",PARTICIPAT.

Il se trouve malheureusement que ces médias qui sont généralement créés par des missionnaires ou des ONG nationales, sont pour certaines, gérés par les communautés elles-mêmes, parfois bénévolement et sans expérience technique. Ce sont souvent les jeunes sans emploi qui sont recrutés sans formation préalable.
C’est pourquoi, les défis auxquels ces radios sont confrontées sont généralement ceux de l’insuffisance de formation dans de nombreux domaines allant de la gestion d’une radio communautaire aux problèmes de maintenance des émetteurs ou de l’animation.

IOC provides intergovernmental coordination for development and harmonization of regional Tsunami Warning Systems in accordance with mandate adopted at 23rd IOC Assembly (2005). IOC provides assistance for countries to develop their National Tsunami Warning Centers within a multi-hazard framework and for maximizing community response through creation of education and awareness.","Outcome 3 - Enhance knowledge for climate action, biodiversity, water and ocean management, and disaster risk reduction","3.IOC1 - Member States critically supported in strengthening their capacity to conduct marine scientific research, generate knowledge, and develop and implement science-based tools, services, and policies in order to reverse the decline in ocean health and accelerate the transition towards sustainable management of ocean-related risks and opportunities",INTERGOVERNMENTAL OCEANOGRAPHIC COMMISSION,Global,"Subsea Data Systems, Inc",Global,,2022-01-01,2025-12-31,
Tsunami Ready - Educating Communities at Risk,"IOC coordinates four regional tsunami warning systems. An effective tsunami early warning system is achieved when all persons, especially in vulnerable coastal communities are prepared and respond appropriately to Tsunami alerts. When combined with dedicated public preparedness efforts, early warning enables communities to know what to do in case of tsunami. In extreme cases (Palu, Indonesia, 2018, Tonga 2022), there may be insufficient time to produce any public alerts. In these instances, vulnerable communities must be educated and ready to act based only on natural warning signs. The IOC Tsunami programme for the UN Decade of Ocean Sciences for Sustainable Development aims to achieve 100% of at-risk communities to become Tsunami Ready by 2030.","Outcome 3 - Enhance knowledge for climate action, biodiversity, water and ocean management, and disaster risk reduction","3.IOC1 - Member States critically supported in strengthening their capacity to conduct marine scientific research, generate knowledge, and develop and implement science-based tools, services, and policies in order to reverse the decline in ocean health and accelerate the transition towards sustainable management of ocean-related risks and opportunities",INTERGOVERNMENTAL OCEANOGRAPHIC COMMISSION,Global,,Global,,2022-01-01,2024-03-31,

DEVELOPMENT OF A NATIONAL OPEN SCIENCE POLICY,"Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI) are fundamental drivers of socio-economic advancement. As part of efforts to strengthen STI for national development, Government through the Ministry of Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation (MESTI), has recently reviewed its National STI Policy (2024-2030) in line with international trends and national priorities. Key to the policy is the adoption and promotion of Open Science Initiatives as an integral instrument for facilitating this transformative journey. 

To this end, the MESTI intends to initiate steps to develop an Open Science Policy in accordance with the 2021 UNESCO Recommendations on Open Science and Ghana’s STI4SDG Road Map.  MESTI seeks to achieve promotion of   a   common   understanding   of   Open   Science, developing an enabling policy environment for Open Science, investing in Open Science infrastructures and services, investing in human resources, education, digital literacy and capacity building for Open Science, fostering a culture of Open Science and aligning incentives for Open Science and promoting innovative approaches for Open Science at different stages of the scientific process.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particul",PARTICIPAT.

"Empowerment of Ugandan Youth Networks and Organizations for Youth-Led Gender-responsive Climate Actions, Research and Development","The Youth Committee of the Uganda National Commission for UNESCO (UNATCOM) established in 2010, has been concerned about the low level of awareness of the youth of Uganda about UNESCO and its programmes designed to empower the youth. Disappointingly, the level of knowledge is not only very low, but even of all the various youth organizations that exist countrywide, only two are associated with UNESCO. These two are UNESCO clubs, one in Gulu University, an upcountry city location and the second at Nakawa Vocational Training College, in Kampala Metropolitan City. This number is too low compared to the situation in the other East African countries such as Rwanda which has 35 UNESCO Clubs and Kenya with 168 UNESCO Clubs and Associations. This is despite the fact that there are many concerns affecting Ugandan youth to address relating to 38.5% of young people aged 10-19 that live in the poorest wealth quintiles, 80% of Uganda’s youth that living  in rural areas and one out of four young people aged 10-24 years residing in urban areas have no means for self-empowerment, 19.6% of young people aged 10-19 years living  in households where the head of household has no education, 22% of adolescents aged 13-18 years dropping out of school while 8.8 million young people aged 15-24 years not engaged in education, employment or under any training1.
Though a National Youth Council Act, 1993 exists, it specifically provides for a National Youth Council which is largely political with no stated focus on the social challenges faced by the youth. There is Uganda Youth Network (UYONET) that purports to be a leading national youth organization working to mainstream young peoples’ engagement in development and governance processes in Uganda and East Africa. This network started in 2002 to respond to the increasing demand for a collective platform for research, training and policy advocacy for young people by young people. However, it does not address the concerns of interest to UNESCO. Statistics indicate  that the youth in Uganda have continued to face multitudes of problems namely: Teenage pregnancy (25% of teenage girls in Uganda age 15-19 have had a child or are pregnant), Health risk behaviors (22% of adolescents have ever had sexual intercourse and  10% of  sexually active adolescents aged 15-19 years had their first sexual encounter before age 15), Child Marriage (10% of women aged 20-24 years married by age 15),  Gender-Based Violence ( 60% of adolescents 10-19 years have experienced physical violence, 42% emotional violence and 10% sexual violence), HIV/AIDS (Every year 9,600 young people aged 15- 19 years are newly infected with HIV)2.  A Cross Sectional Survey Study conducted by scholars show that alcohol, substance use and psychosocial competence of adolescents in selected Secondary Schools in Uganda was at 70% 3.

Radio Program on Early Childhood Development and Education in Liberia,"Despite the recognized importance of early childhood development and education, there is a lack of widespread awareness and accessible information on best practices and resources for parents, caregivers, and communities in Liberia. Many families, especially in remote or rural areas, may not have access to formal early childhood education programs or may not be fully informed about the critical role they play in fostering their child’s cognitive, social, and emotional development. This gap in knowledge and resources poses a risk to the overall well-being and future success of Liberian children. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a targeted radio program that focuses on raising awareness, providing practical information, and promoting effective strategies for early childhood development and education, ensuring that all children in Liberia have the opportunity to thrive and reach their full potential.

The World Bank (2008), conducted research and provided reports on various aspects of education and development worldwide, offering insights into the importance of investing in early childhood education programs to widen the scope of understanding, especially in the rural areas of the country.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particul",PARTICIPAT.

GPE LEG Assessment for Zanzibar,"The System Capacity Grant (SCG) Is a funding mechanism provided by GPE to support developing countries in strengthening their education systems. It is designed to help countries improve their education systems by building capacity in planning, management, monitoring, and evaluation areas, ultimately leading to better learning outcomes for children and young people. The current SCG will support Tanzania's Local Education Group (LEG) self-assessment. 
While UNICEF will serve as the Grant Agent for the SCG, the LEG self-assessment will fall under UNESCO as the GPE Coordinating Agent. This partnership between UNICEF and UNESCO is crucial in ensuring that education initiatives are coordinated effectively, and that the government can improve education outcomes for all children in Tanzania. By working together, UNICEF and UNESCO can leverage their respective strengths to support a more comprehensive and sustainable approach to education development in the country.

Additionally, the Ministry of Health has highlighted a rise in mental health issues among school youth and the prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs).
While the Scouts and Sports Division continues to promote sports and physical activities, it has been observed that not all children have access to sports due to a lack of resources and sports infrastructure. Therefore, there is a pressing need to focus on non-traditional sports (free play), which are easy to organise, inexpensive, and beneficial to child development and education.

IMPROVING THE  ENROLMENT  OF  FEMALE   SAHO  CHILDREN  THROUGH MOBILIZING THE SAHO COMMUNITY.,"Southern Region is one of the densely populated regions of the country (Eritrea). Currently, it has about 800,000 population. It is one of the regions which share common boundary with Ethiopia. Large portion of the population in the region is affected by the 1998-2000 war of aggression, which was waged by the Tigray regime that resulted in the displacement of about 38 Schools with 22,202 students and 372 teachers.  The Tigray claimed some parts of these sub regions. School Facilities were pillaged by the Tigray military force.  
Although virtual demarcation had been given by the Hague, there had been skirmishes until 2022. As a result, there is feeling of trauma in the children.  There is a need of helping the people in general and the children in particular.
The economic activities of the region are predominantly agricultural with a very limited semi-pastoralism in the lowland areas.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particul",PARTICIPAT.

Promouvoir la culture de l’anticipation avec les communautés scolaire et universitaire de la ville de Bouaké par l’éducation prospective,"Il est courant d’entendre les gouvernants dire que l’avenir des Etats appartient à la jeunesse. Cette réalité est encore plus vivante en Afrique où la jeunesse représente, selon de nombreuses recherches menées sur le dividende démographique, environ 60 % de la population totale du continent (PNUD, 2023). De ce fait, l’Afrique est un continent avec une population essentiellement jeune qui pourrait stimuler le développement économique. Elle est la principale force active et éduquée de la population. Et pourtant, cette jeunesse se trouve plutôt apeurée par son avenir en raison des tendances actuelles qui n’augurent point d’un futur radieux. Si cette situation a des facteurs explicatifs liés à l’efficacité des politiques publiques dédiées à la jeunesse, elle est aussi liée au fait que cette jeunesse ne dispose pas toujours des rudiments nécessaires pour explorer son avenir, le lire et se projeter raisonnablement dans le futur souhaité. Cet état de fait a pour incidence, tant à l’échelle personnelle que nationale, d’empêcher, d’inhiber voire de détruire le potentiel d’innovation et d’imagination de cette jeunesse qui est censée être au cœur du développement des nations. Dans la ville de Bouaké, en Côte d’Ivoire, cette situation est d’actualité et soutenue par un taux d’analphabétisme estimé à 43% (Mairie de Bouaké, 2023) et 54,9% de taux de chômage (INS, ENV 2015). 

En vue de créer donc un cadre exploratoire de compréhension du futur, la Chaire UNESCO Anticipation, Prospective et Territoires Durables de l’Université Alassane OUATTARA initie le projet « Promouvoir la culture de l’anticipation avec les communautés scolaire et universitaire de la ville de Bouaké par l’éducation prospective» dans le but d’expérimenter l’éducation prospective dans les établissements scolaires et universitaires de la ville de Bouaké afin de promouvoir la culture de l’anticipation auprès de la jeunesse pour la rendre plus créatrice et prospective. Ce projet s’inscrit dans le cadre de l’ODD 4 « Education de qualité » visant à faire en sorte que tous puissent suivre une éducation de qualité dans des conditions d’équité et promouvoir les opportunités d’apprentissage tout au long de la vie.  

Pour des sociétés résilientes et inclusives, il convient de mettre les outils de la prospective à la disposition de tous. Ce projet vise à démocratiser la prospective de sorte à amener les communautés scolaire et universitaire à être lettré du futur en réactivant en elles le pouvoir de l’imagination dans ces moments d’incertitudes. Il ne s’agit plus de faire de la prospective une chasse gardée de l’élite là où l’urgence bat son plein au sein des communautés. Il s’agit de susciter une mobilisation collective pour une meilleure inclusivité de la prospective en préparant les esprits aux changements. Ce projet entend faire de l’imagination, un puissant outil de co-construction et de mobilisation collective des avenirs des communautés scolaire et universitaire de Bouaké.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particul",PARTICIPAT.

Projet de promotion d’une société égalitaire par l’éducation et la formation de la jeune fille en vue de son autonomisation,"Ce projet vise à asseoir l’autonomisation de la jeune fille à travers la promotion de l’égalité des genres qui ne va pas sans prôner le principe de l’égalité des chances homme-femme. 

Pour ce faire, il y a lieu de juguler les disparités de genre qui touchent particulièrement l’analphabétisme, la vulnérabilité et la discrimination de la jeune fille. Ce sont les défis visés par l’Organisation porteuse de ce projet. Ainsi il est à distinguer deux groupes de jeunes filles qui méritent un accompagnement : celles dites vulnérables car analphabètes ou déscolarisés ; et celles qui sont scolarisées mais limités à des filières dites « féminines », donc peu représentées dans les domaines scientifiques.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particul",PARTICIPAT.

"Zero violence and no bullying"" project with awareness campaigns and school sports","The human mind is a complex system of interacting processes that generate, encode, transform, and manipulate information of various kinds. According to Almeida (1988), reasoning is associated with concepts such as intelligence, problem solving, and comprehension/thinking. It can be considered a cognitive valence, especially when approached in the discovery of relationships, comparison of elements and choice of alternatives among the answers.

In a game of chess, the use of reasoning is paramount to make well-defined moves. Vygotsky (1998) states that, &quot;although in the game of chess there is no direct substitution for real-life relations, it is undoubtedly a type of imaginary situation&quot;. By learning chess, the student would be developing socially available skills and knowledge, being able to contribute to their self-esteem, that is, without understanding there is no understanding and without understanding there is no learning. 

It should be noted that the game of chess is a form of playful-educational entertainment capable of developing in children and young people the ability to concentrate, memory, judgment, imagination, anticipation, will win, patience, self-control, decision-making, mathematical logic, creativity and intelligence. 

The actions were elaborated in a collaborative and inclusive perspective, which constitute one of the typical principles of UNESCO and by their nature can be an important option to ensure the integration of school activities in times of social isolation and can be used as a way to form values such as respect for differences, non-discrimination and bullying, the reduction of school dropouts and the identification of talents.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particul",PARTICIPAT.

Understanding the Gaps in Cancer Education and Awareness in Bangladesh and Finding Prospective Solutions: A Special Emphasis on Stigmas and Challenges Among Women,"Despite progress in cancer management, Bangladesh faces formidable challenges to overcome stigma and misunderstanding around cancers. The challenge is even bigger for women who suffers from breast and ovarian cancers(1). Bangladesh has enormous problem regarding cancer awareness and education among general people. Proper research is also lacking here to meet these challenges. With the involvement of Sir Walter Bodmer from the University of oxford who has long experience in cancer research and science communication, and leading figures from Bangladesh, this project aims to bridge the gaps through trainings, seminars, social media awareness campaigns, and community outreach by targeting students, communities, and healthcare professionals. Specific strategies include understanding cancer stigmas, gaps in cancer education and cancer prevention, addressing doctor-patient relationship challenges with a practical manual, and engaging diverse speakers. The project plans events in educational institutions, villages, and conference halls/hospitals. Overall, the initiative seeks to enhance the understanding on cancer education, eradicate fear, and foster stronger connections between healthcare providers and patients.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particul",PARTICIPAT.

THE COLLECTION and DOCUMENTATION OF THE TRADITIONAL COSTUMES,"Vanuatu is a vibrant and culturally diverse archipelago in terms of traditional costumes. Each village on the island of Vanuatu has its respective traditional costumes. The practice of making these traditional costumes is also very diverse depending on the villages and the islands. Moreover, with natural disasters, more particularly climate change, and the rise of the sea level, which is advancing at high speed, we must imperatively protect and safeguard our traditional knowledge as well as the plants for manufacturing these cultural artifacts. For this, an inventory should be urgently carried out to assess the situation concerning the plants from which plant is derived and lost. Emphasis should be placed on strategies to re-establish viable stocks of these plants on an island. Traditional exchanges of these costumes should be encouraged to perpetuate their know-how and their manufacture. Knowledge and oral knowledge of the traditional origins of these costumes should be urgently recorded by collecting from the men or women of each village.
The production and use of traditional costumes play an essential role in many rituals for the indigenous people of Vanuatu and should be revived and perpetuated. For this, a documentation and photography project should be undertaken for this purpose to document and archive all the stages of the production chain of these traditional costumes.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particul",PARTICIPAT.

The platform makes passive learning more interactive and dynamic by incorporating interactive elements like scripted lessons across the curricula, quizzes, simulations, and multimedia content. In addition, the platform can be used to analysis data and monitor student progress and identify areas for improvement. By collecting and analysing student performance data, educators can gain insights into individual learning needs and tailor instruction accordingly. This data-driven approach to education allows for personalised learning pathways that address each student’s unique strengths and challenges, resulting in better learning outcomes. </span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""> </span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">By incorporating innovative features such as SD cards, Open Educational Resources (OER) materials, and interactive worksheets, the platform becomes more versatile and adaptable to the diverse needs of Gambian students. Integrating SD cards, Open Educational Resources (OER) materials, and interactive worksheets into the ilearngambia platform improves education access by ensuring flexibility, scalability, and inclusivity. SD cards provide offline access, which is especially important in areas with limited internet access. OER materials democratise learning by making resources available for free and adaptable. Interactive worksheets actively engage students, which improves comprehension and retention. These provisions, taken together, empower learners, educators, and communities in Gambia, fostering knowledge sharing and skill development. The provision of these additional learning infrastructures ensures that students even in remote areas can utilise the platform without being hampered by connectivity issues. SD cards offer offline access to a variety of educational materials, such as textbooks, videos, and interactive exercises, allowing for continuous learning regardless of location or internet access. OER materials democratises education by providing free and openly licenced resources that can be adapted and shared by both educators and learners. Educators can customise learning materials to meet their students&#39; specific needs and interests, resulting in a more personalised and engaging learning experience.

"Promote Ecosystem Approaches and Collaborative Natural Resource Management for Climate Change Adaptation in disaster-prone, high-risk and UNESCO-designated sites in Uganda.","Whereas Uganda Government has put in place a legislation called the Uganda wildlife Act 2019 to provide for the conservation and sustainable management of wildlife and streamlining the roles and responsibilities of institutions involved in wildlife conservation and management and for related matters, this law does not make any provisions, let alone mention, the Biosphere Reserves and other globally-designated sites anywhere in the document.  This unfortunate lack of domestication of the MAB principles in the law in the case of the  Biosphere Reserves  means that the principles  of MAB as a scientific Programme for promoting scientific research on human populations’ interaction with ecosystems, the cooperation between all the scientific disciplines to better understand human-nature interactions through science, through education, through training and through building capacities of communities in a Biosphere Reserve setting is not actively promoted.   

 While Section 32 of the Act provides for “Historic rights of communities around conservation areas”, the rights so granted are subject to the guidelines to be provided by the Authority like access to resources which are historically crucial to the survival of those communities. This conditional provision for the indigenous communities who are historically part and parcel of the ecosystem is however different from the Biosphere Reserve management which calls for coexistence between the community and the ecosystem in a consultatively zoned areas designated for the purposes as defined in the MAB Principles. The drive of MAB to overcome conflicts between people’s livelihoods and nature through a “rational” use of natural resources, to establish or re-establish “harmony” between people and their environment is missed out and this has made  it easy to alienate the indigenous communities in these sites from their natural environment. The conflicts between the management of these sites with the indigenous communities have continued due to the, management of these sites without the application of the Biosphere Reserve principles. Although a MAB National Committees exists, the lack of provision for them in the Law governing these protected areas makes it difficult for them to exercise the roles laid down in the MAB Strategy and the WNBR. The same problem exists with the other globally-important sites designated under UNESCO like the 4 World Heritage Sites in the Country. 

 
There are continuing complaints of communities about unfairness in the policies regulating the Biosphere Reserves as punishment is meted out to them when they enter into what should be buffer zones in the Biosphere reserves.  Whereas the communities have complaints of hostility of UWA Officials and Game Rangers towards them (See the Monitor Newspaper January 30th 2024, story below), the UWA Officials also complain of intransigence of the communities, and political interference by the leaders of the communities in the Biosphere reserves. The conservation agency counter-accused the Communities of killing 15 of its staff (rangers) and injuring 35 others between 2002 to 2023. The other BR, Queen Elizabeth, has also experience intermittent conflicts between pastoralists and the conservation managers. 

Other problems associated with land use include the emerging accounts of how nomadic pastoralists called “Balaalo” have migrated to areas of other communities resulting to conflicts in those areas. Such accounts not only depict images of pastoralism as being an outmoded and inefficient livelihood system but also pastoralists as people who are understood almost exclusively through discourses of conflict, insecurity and lawlessness, amongst others. This can potentially contribute to cycles of violence by manipulation of pastoralists against themselves and other local communities. There are also fears of spread of livestock diseases resulting to epidemic in the new areas being migrated to. Some of the encroachments have been to the protected areas of National Forestry Authority. However, all these point to the lack of knowledge appropriate land use practices for climate action, biodiversity, water management and disaster risk reduction (Outcome 3) resulting from non-inclusive development in the country where certain communities have remained excluded from knowledge and skills in  sustainable management of natural resources and disaster risk resilience.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particul",PARTICIPAT.

World Space Day Celebration Week,"World Space Week has been officially declared by the United Nations as the annual week from 4 to 10 October. It is an international celebration of the contribution of space science and technology to improving the human condition. The dates that mark World Space Week commemorate landmark events of the space age: on 4 October 1957, Sputnik I, the first man-made Earth satellite, was launched. The Treaty on the Peaceful Exploration of Outer Space was signed by UN member states on 10 October 1967.
The celebration of World Space Week is an excellent opportunity to highlight the achievements and potential of space exploration on a global level. World Space Week usually takes place in October and involves a variety of activities, including talks, workshops, exhibitions, competitions and much more.
On 4 October 1957, the launch into outer space of the first man-made Earth satellite, Sputnik 1, paved the way for space exploration. A decade later, on 10 October 1967, the Treaty on the Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies entered into force.
Space science and technology and their applications are increasingly being used to support a wide range of United Nations activities. At least 25 United Nations entities and the World Bank Group routinely use space applications. They make important and sometimes essential contributions to the work of the United Nations, including in implementing the recommendations of major world conferences and the Third United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNISPACE III), as well as in supporting sustainable development.
Since the dawn of the Space Age, the United Nations has recognised that outer space has added a new dimension to humanity&#39;s existence. The United Nations family continually strives to utilise the unique benefits of outer space for the betterment of all humanity.
Recognising humanity&#39;s common interest in outer space and seeking to answer questions about how outer space can help benefit the peoples of the Earth, the General Assembly adopted its first resolution related to outer space, resolution 1348 (XIII) entitled &quot;Question of the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space&quot;.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particularly in Africa, developing countries, LDCs, and SIDS",PARTICIPAT.

"Entrepreneurship Empowering young men, girls and students to participate in entrepreneurship using communications and information technology in the modern era, and to contribute to achieving sustainable development goals.","Introduction
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) gives great attention to building a society of knowledge and information, inclusive of all, to achieve sustainable development, innovation and leadership in the use of communication and information technology for the purposes of education and entrepreneurship, and ensuring that everyone’s equal participation in the development of society is an essential factor in achieving: 
	The fourth goal of sustainable development, which is related to the quality of education, 
	The fifth goal, which considers gender equality, 
	The ninth goal, which relates to industry and innovation; by strengthening industry and innovation, new economic opportunities can be provided, and increase and speed of access to sources of information and technology can be available, which enhances economic development and contributes to protection of fundamental freedoms.
	The tenth goal, which relates to alleviating gaps in societies and between countries, 
	The seventeenth goal, which relates to partnerships to achieve the goals. 

This aims to enhance international cooperation and partnerships between the public and private sectors and civil society, to achieve the goals of sustainable development, including the protection of freedoms, and providing access to information for all. This is to enhance the capabilities of young people, achieve the principle of universal access to information, and provide opportunities for comprehensive, equitable quality education and lifelong learning for all, and for the different marginalized and vulnerable groups (women, girls, youth, and people with special needs).
The progress achieved in the field of communications and information technology and the increasing interconnectedness between the societies of knowledge will enhance work to advance innovation, entrepreneurship, renovation, and creating new job opportunities for youth, women, and girls to improve the standard of their living and income. Open resources programs of information and technology provide the opportunity to support and empower developing countries and all individuals and society. They also ensures social and economic inclusion for all, which contributes to achieving sustainable development goals and reducing the percentage of young people deprived of jobs, education or training opportunities.
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has a major role in enhancing the effective contribution of women and girls in the field of using communication and information technology in the fields of education, science and culture. Due to people’s increasing reliance on digital technological means, the use of social media creates opportunities of work for young people, and at the same time creates great challenges. Opportunities that can be seized in this regard include social learning, innovation, knowledge exchange, democratic participation, and intercultural dialogue. One of the most important challenges that must be addressed is the spread of misinformation and widespread disinformation, which directly affects young people as the main users of the internet and social media globally.
Through this project, the Egyptian National Committee, as a link between the UNESCO and the concerned parties, will contribute to building an inclusive society of knowledge and information to achieve sustainable development by creating a specialized training package in entrepreneurship and making good use of modern technology and artificial intelligence tools to qualify young people for the labor market and increase their capabilities for compete globally.
Through this project, the Egyptian National Committee will provide partnerships and cooperation between:

1. Educational institutions and teachers who play an essential role in enhancing media and information literacy among learners and enabling them to acquire the necessary competencies to participate in the digital field as global citizens. It will take place at all levels of primary and secondary education, as well as in the field of adult learning.
2. Youth organizations, young people and especially young women; young people are the most active users of digital technologies, therefore it is necessary to ensure that they acquire the necessary digital competencies in the field of media and information literacy, and to ensure their ability to have effective entrepreneurship that enables them to create the desired impact to face the challenges related to the development of this field. So, the necessary measures will be taken to achieve the following:
•	Enabling young people to acquire competencies in the field of media, information literacy and digital competencies and using them as peer educators
•	Enhancing the capacity of youth-led organizations to integrate media and information literacy into their activities, policies and strategies through means that include encouraging intercultural dialogue to achieve understanding;
•	Supporting effective youth actions that enable young people to find the necessary solutions and play an active role as they are able to bring about the desired change in order to achieve social inclusion and combat all forms of exclusion, racism and discrimination in the digital field;
•	Assuring that young people’s use of digital technologies, and the impact of these means on them is part and parcel of comprehensive youth development approaches in youth policies;
•	Enhancing science-based youth organizations to have the desired impact in decision-making processes;
•	Relying on advances and developments in the field of neurotechnology to find solutions to serious mental health problems.

3. Media institutions and media workers; by establishing partnerships with digital communications platforms as principal actors to integrate media and information literacy in digital spaces.
Working with the above-mentioned groups, the necessary links will be created between them to put relevant tools on digital learning and guidelines on digital citizenship into practice. This is to cope with UNESCO’s endeavors to take gender equality into account as one of its main areas of focus, while recognizing the digital gap that exists between men and women, which prevents women and girls from benefiting from digital technology and participating in the digital field through engaging men and boys as responsible allies to advance gender equality in the digital sphere.

This will help the concerned authorities integrate in providing overall solutions for young people to confront economic conditions, and benefit from information, open source software, and modern artificial intelligence tools, and harness digital technological means to build peace and achieve sustainable development and build inclusive knowledge societies, through the use of open solutions (open educational resources, open access and open data);
This project enhances the contribution to the Information for All program and contributes to the endeavors aimed at achieving the two goals; universal access to information and inclusion of all in the digital era.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particularly in Africa, developing countries, LDCs, and SIDS",PARTICIPAT.

"Fortalecimiento de las habilidades de educadores y educadoras de la EPJA. Hacia la  circulación social, la participación igualitaria y la cultura: la ciudad como ambiente de  aprendizaje","El proyecto se propone difundir y sensibilizar en el país la importancia de la Educación de 
Personas Jóvenes y Adultas (EPJA) de acuerdo a la definición aprobada en la Recomendación 
sobre el Aprendizaje y la Educación de Adultos, Conferencia General de la UNESCO, Reunión 38ª 
Adoptada el 13 de noviembre de 2015 y las orientaciones acordadas en la VII Conferencia 
Internacional de Educación de Adultos (CONFINTEA) en el Marco de Acción de Marrakech:
“Aprovechar el poder transformador del aprendizaje y la educación de adultos” el Objetivo de 
Desarrollo Sustentable 4: “Garantizar una educación inclusiva, equitativa y de calidad y promover 
oportunidades de aprendizaje durante toda la vida para todos”, contemplado en la Agenda 2030 
de Naciones Unidas.
En este sentido, a partir de estos contenidos fundamentales, se procurará adecuarlos a las 
necesidades e intereses de los diferentes territorios del país, donde trabajan educadoras y 
educadores, en un país donde no se cuenta con una formación específica en EPJA.
Por lo tanto, es necesario, entonces relevar el estado de situaciones particulares a tener en cuenta 
en el diseño de los diferentes módulos que integran el ciclo formativo.
Se prestará especial atención a quienes trabajan:
- en la enseñanza de las personas que no han culminado la enseñanza primaria y media; 
- con mujeres, especialmente aquellas que cursen o desean cursar formación técnica, profesional 
y superior;
- con personas jóvenes, adultas y adultas mayores, especialmente quienes desean adquirir 
competencias técnicas y profesionales, para acceder al empleo, el trabajo decente y el 
emprendedurismo;
- con personas que se encuentran en situación de vulnerabilidad.
Se relevará, sistematizará y dará respuestas a las demandas formativas de colectivos locales del 
interior del país, a través del desarrollo de acciones formativas en educación ciudadana para 
educadores/as, atendiendo a las dificultades de las personas jóvenes y adultas de esa región para 
acceder y sostener aprendizajes más allá del sistema formal de educación, donde los grupos 
postergados y vulnerables, en particular, mujeres y jóvenes, son los más afectados.

posibilidad de ser reeditado en el futuro, una propuesta de educación virtual de alcance nacional, 
focalizada en los contenidos que ha sistematizado la Cátedra UNESCO EPJA en Uruguay

Creación y Conformación del Comite Nacional del MOST Paraguay,"El objetivo de este proyecto es la instalación del Comité Nacional del MOST en Paraguay.

A lo largo de los años, el Consejo Intergubernamental del Programa MOST ha subrayado el papel crucial Comités Nacionales y el valor de su contribución, destacando la importancia de mantenerlos en el contexto específico de cada país. Se alienta a los Estados Miembros de la UNESCO a establecer un comité nacional para alcanzar los objetivos del Programa MOST y, en particular, para desarrollar las capacidades nacionales en el área de las ciencias sociales.

El objetivo fundamental de un Comité Nacional MOST es el de fortalecer las capacidades nacionales de investigación en ciencias sociales (1), a fin de contribuir en el logro de las prioridades nacionales, y fomentar el vínculo entre la investigación social y los actores políticos que trabajan en el sector del desarrollo social.

Para cumplir con las formalidades necesarias, se inscribiría el Comité Nacional MOST Paraguay, en el Consejo Intergubernamental (CIG) del Programa de Gestión de las Transformaciones Sociales (MOST).

Los Comités Nacionales tienen la misión de lograr los objetivos del Programa MOST a nivel país. Persiguen los mismos objetivos, pero cada comité nacional tiene sus propias prioridades.

En el caso paraguayo, el desarrollo de las ciencias sociales, ha logrado avances en la última década como la creación de la Facultad de Ciencias Sociales en la Universidad Nacional de Asunción, el desarrollo de investigaciones y el apoyo a investigadores a través de programas del Consejo Nacional de Ciencias y Tecnología (CONACYT), la posibilidad de realizar cursos de postgrado en universidades extranjeras a través del Programa de Becas Carlos Antonio López (BECAL). La creación de universidades públicas y privadas en diferentes partes del país.

A pesar de estos avances todavía se necesita en el país un mayor impulso en el campo de la investigación, la difusión de los resultados y la utilización de los mismos en la formulación de las políticas públicas. Las políticas no siempre dialogan con las ciencias sociales y en ocasiones, a pesar de contar con datos e informes provenientes de investigaciones, estos no son aprovechados para el diseño y el mejoramiento de las políticas públicas, los planes y programas.

Además, Paraguay requiere mayor comunicación e intercambio con grupos académicos y e investigadores y centros académicos a nivel regional e internacional.

A partir de la instalación del Comité Nacional MOST, se elaborará una Agenda de Trabajo, con reuniones mensuales, observando las problemáticas sociales y coyunturales del país.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particul",PARTICIPAT.

Fossil and Stratigraphy Identification to study on Paleo-environment of Sount-west Cambodia,"In the wake of an extraordinary milestone in Cambodia&#39;s scientific narrative, the discovery and publication of the country&#39;s inaugural dinosaur fossil. this proposal, titled Fossil and Stratigraphy Identification to study on Paleo-environment of Sount-west Cambodia takes center stage. The preliminary study conducted by the Department of Heritage Park, the General Department of the local Community,  Ministry of Environment of Cambodia, unveils a fascinating revelation. Between the years 2019 and 2023, 59 fossil-rich locations have been identified in Banteay Meanchey, Battambang, Koh Kong, Strung Treng, Ratanakiri, Prah Vihear, Posat, and Siem Reap Provinces, as reported in the department&#39;s preliminary findings).

These identified locations boast a diverse array of fossil types, ranging from marine fossils to petrified woods, enigmatic footprints etched in time, and dinosaur skeletons that have been published in MPDI as international articles of fossil studies. The significance of this discovery reverberates through Cambodia&#39;s natural landscape, urging us to embark on an ambitious journey of exploration and identification.

Despite the richness of these fossil sites in Koh Kong and Kompot provinces, the details surrounding the fossils, biostratigraphy, and paleontology remain largely undocumented. The preliminary study underscores a critical gap in our understanding, primarily attributed to a lack of expertise and specialized equipment. In response, this proposal seeks to address and bridge these gaps, propelling Cambodia into a new era of scientific exploration and documentation.

Through meticulous identification, study, and documentation of these fossils, we aim to elevate Cambodia&#39;s standing in the global paleontological community. Furthermore, by nominating key fossil-rich sites for consideration on the UNESCO Global Geopark and /or World Heritage List for  Natural Heritage, Cambodia aspires to not only safeguard its paleontological treasures but also to contribute invaluable insights to the broader understanding of Earth&#39;s ancient history.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particularly in Africa, developing countries, LDCs, and SIDS",PARTICIPAT.

"Develop and enhance digital literacy of science, math, and multimedia technology educators in Timor-Leste through capacity building and comparative study.","Information, communication, and technology (ICT) have impacted the global society on how to network and impact human life. However, for developing countries like Timor-Leste, there needs to be a gap in how to introduce and integrate it into the education system. They considered the importance of ICT in the education system and realized that capacity building for their educators and the facilities that help support the implementation process is essential. Therefore, the Timor-Leste National Commission for UNESCO (TLNCU) would like to collaborate with the SEAMEO STEM-ED in Thailand to get capacity building related to digital literacy in science and math. After that, TLNCU collaborates with the teacher&#39;s training institute in Timor-Leste (INFORDEPE) to train high school science, math, and multimedia teachers on applying and integrating technology in the teaching process. To introduce, create, and develop didactic materials that integrate with technology, TLNCU expects that at the end of 2024, six trainers will train by SEAMEO STEMED-ED and be able to conduct teacher training for 78 science and math teachers around 13 municipalities.

THE COLLECTION and DOCUMENTATION OF THE TRADITIONAL COSTUMES,"Vanuatu is a vibrant and culturally diverse archipelago in terms of traditional costumes. Each village on the island of Vanuatu has its respective traditional costumes. The practice of making these traditional costumes is also very diverse depending on the villages and the islands. Moreover, with natural disasters, more particularly climate change, and the rise of the sea level, which is advancing at high speed, we must imperatively protect and safeguard our traditional knowledge as well as the plants for manufacturing these cultural artifacts. For this, an inventory should be urgently carried out to assess the situation concerning the plants from which plant is derived and lost. Emphasis should be placed on strategies to re-establish viable stocks of these plants on an island. Traditional exchanges of these costumes should be encouraged to perpetuate their know-how and their manufacture. Knowledge and oral knowledge of the traditional origins of these costumes should be urgently recorded by collecting from the men or women of each village.
The production and use of traditional costumes play an essential role in many rituals for the indigenous people of Vanuatu and should be revived and perpetuated. For this, a documentation and photography project should be undertaken for this purpose to document and archive all the stages of the production chain of these traditional costumes.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particularly in Africa, developing countries, LDCs, and SIDS",PARTICIPAT.

DEVELOPMENT OF A NATIONAL OPEN SCIENCE POLICY,"Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI) are fundamental drivers of socio-economic advancement. As part of efforts to strengthen STI for national development, Government through the Ministry of Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation (MESTI), has recently reviewed its National STI Policy (2024-2030) in line with international trends and national priorities. Key to the policy is the adoption and promotion of Open Science Initiatives as an integral instrument for facilitating this transformative journey. 

To this end, the MESTI intends to initiate steps to develop an Open Science Policy in accordance with the 2021 UNESCO Recommendations on Open Science and Ghana’s STI4SDG Road Map.  MESTI seeks to achieve promotion of   a   common   understanding   of   Open   Science, developing an enabling policy environment for Open Science, investing in Open Science infrastructures and services, investing in human resources, education, digital literacy and capacity building for Open Science, fostering a culture of Open Science and aligning incentives for Open Science and promoting innovative approaches for Open Science at different stages of the scientific process.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particularly in Africa, developing countries, LDCs, and SIDS",PARTICIPAT.

Effects of Electronic and medical waste on the Environment and Human Health: Engaging Schools and Communities to advocate for a more resilient ecosystem management,"As we sail through the digital age, a new frontier has emerged in the realm of environmental protection—the online sphere. This vast interconnected landscape has become an essential catalyst in propelling discussions about various environmental issues, and medical waste management sits at the forefront of these conversations. According to statistics, of the total waste generated by health-care activities, 15% is considered hazardous material that may be infectious, toxic, or radioactive. Given the tremendous environmental repercussions associated with mishandling medical waste, it is imperative to address this issue head-on. In this project write-up, we will explore the intricate dynamics of medical waste, its environmental impact, the role of technology, existing challenges, and inspirational initiatives that provide a beacon of hope.
Medical waste is a huge environmental issue and according to records, every year, an estimated 16 billion injections are administered worldwide, but not all of the needles and syringes are properly disposed of afterward. Furthermore, the advent of the Covid pandemic has exacerbated the impact of medical waste. As demand for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) – including gloves, masks, and gowns – grew worldwide in response to the Covid-19 outbreak in the last two years, medical waste disposal rates skyrocketed.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are 8 types of medical waste: (Infectious waste, Pathological waste, Sharps waste, Chemical waste, Pharmaceutical waste, Cytotoxic waste, Radioactive waste, Non-hazardous or general waste).

The Covid-19 pandemic was not just a public health crisis, but an environmental crisis, too. An estimated 8 million metric tons of plastics already enter the ocean on an annual basis. According to a report by the World Health Organization, the medical waste accumulated during the pandemic increased plastic pollution in the oceans by 10 times.


On the other hand electrical and electronic devices generating e-waste are from IT and telecommunication equipment and consumer electrical/electronic products such as refrigerators, washing machines, computers and its accessories, brails, mobile phones and chargers, remotes, compact discs, headphones, batteries, LCD/Plasma TVs, i-pods, air conditioners, dryers, fridge, VCRs, stereos, copiers, fax machines, video games, presenters, music system and other household appliances etc. many of which contain toxic materials. It is estimated that about 50 million tonnes of e-waste is generated every year all over the world.

Consequently, as the Gambia is part of the global community, the management of hazardous electric/electronic and medical waste forms part of the major challenges the country is grappling with like many developing countries. Medical and e-waste are major problems posing very significant health and environmental hazards.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particularly in Africa, developing countries, LDCs, and SIDS",PARTICIPAT.

DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE CONTENT MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES AND ENHANCING STAFF CAPACITIES FOR OPTIMAL UTILIZATION OF MOES VIRTUAL INFORMATION CENTRE,"The Ministry of Education and Sports (MoES) in Uganda has made significant strides in enhancing access to a diverse array of educational resources by establishing a digital/Virtual Information Centre (VIC) with support from UNESCO during the last Biennium, serving as a vital platform for disseminating crucial educational resources and information materials to both internal stakeholders within the MoES and the broader public.
Despite the extensive resources available within the centre, their utilization remains significantly below potential. This underutilization is primarily due to the absence of effective content management strategies and insufficient staff capacities among others.
Building upon this foundation, this project aims to develop comprehensive content management strategies, enhance staff capacities and promote the VIC among other stakeholders to maximize the utilization of the MoES Virtual Information Centre (VIC) in Uganda.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particularly in Africa, developing countries, LDCs, and SIDS",PARTICIPAT.

"Capacity building and awareness creation of law enforcement officers on safety of Journalists, freedom of expression and the right to information in Uganda","Media Workers and Law enforcement agencies are often faced with many challenges to balance the rights to freedom of expression with the imperative to maintain impartiality and public order management. During turbulent times, law enforcement agencies have had to manage public safety issues around elections, natural disasters and public health emergencies, and facilitate respect for freedom of expression and the right to peaceful assembly. Political, social and economic circumstances have increasingly encouraged unrest among the public, placing officers in often difficult situations.
Against this backdrop, journalists and their freedom are increasingly threathened. A total of 1,088 journalsist have been killed for their work or while on job within the last 12 years. In the first half of 2022 alone, 45 media professionals have been killed. In response, government and law enforcement agencies have had to examine their ways of dealing with public order issues, working with journalists and communicating effectively with the public.
Despite the fact that media in Uganda has tremendously expanded and that Uganda’s 1995 constitution, the Press and Journalist Act, 1995 and other existing laws guarantee press freedom, so little has been done to promote media rights, safety and improvement of the working climate and conditions . The threats to free expression and access to information still remain in place. Together with the growing influence of business interests on the media, the threats continue to pose major challenges to the campaign for open dialogue, democratic rights and good governance in Uganda.  Concerns of this nature continue to keep human rights defenders in the country on their toes in search for ways to protect and promote open spaces where divergent ideas can flourish to foster democracy.
The Ugandan constitution and other existing laws guarantee press freedom, but the state actors usually ignores them at will. To compound the problem, the rate of impunity for crimes against journalists, media workers and social media producers remains high. Those involved in harassing media are never investigated and prosecuted. It is upon this background that we need as a country to promote press freedom at all level so that the gains realized is not washed away by the State actors.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particularly in Africa, developing countries, LDCs, and SIDS",PARTICIPAT.

PROMOTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND CLIMATE CHANGE EDUCATION IN THE PRIMARY TEACHERS TRAINING CURRICULUM,"The project has been designed to promote integration of environmental education including climate change into the Primary Teachers Training Curriculum in Uganda.  
The approach to implementation of the project will include reviewing the existing Primary Teachers training curriculum for integration of environmental education. The review process will be participatory involving key actors in Teacher Education training and development. Workshops will be organized to assess teaching content including curriculum guides, leaners’ textbooks, examination papers and related materials among others. The review process will also help in determining tentative themes and some of the key actors to be engaged in subsequent stages.  This will be followed by participatory consultations where both physical and virtual media will be utilized and validation of the first report will be undertaken. The consultations and data collection are expected to target pre- service teachers’ learners in Primary Schools, District Education Officers, District Inspectors of Schools, Area Centre Coordinating Tutors, community members and environmental experts, educators including in service teachers, school administrators, curriculum specialists, examiners, education policy makers and related institutions among others. A series of engagements will be organized for data and information generation, validation, reporting and dissemination. The next stage will involve development of the Tutors guide or manual.

Projet d’éducation à la gestion durable des ressources en eau dans les établissements scolaires du Burkina Faso,"Le projet d’éducation à la gestion durable des ressources dans les établissements scolaires du Burkina Faso véhicule des messages forts à travers ce constat : 

  L’eau est une grande préoccupation dans les pays de l’Afrique de l’Ouest et sa bonne gestion est un devoir pour les gouvernants qui ont une obligation de moyens et pour chaque citoyen qui se doit d’adopter les bons comportements pour assurer la pérennité de cette ressource en eau. Bien plus que la vulnérabilité des pays de la zone face à une pluviométrie largement déficitaire et irrégulière, la prise de conscience des enjeux liés à l’eau a progressivement convergé vers un consensus pour une approche innovatrice de gestion des ressources en eau.

Promoting Female Sanitation and Hygiene Awareness Through Radio Programs,"The project aims to promote female sanitation and hygiene awareness in high schools in Liberia through radio programs. This initiative recognizes the importance of promoting good hygiene practices among young girls to improve their overall health and well-being. By utilizing radio programs, the project intends to reach a wide audience of high school students and educate them on proper sanitation and hygiene practices specifically tailored to the needs of adolescent girls. The content of the radio programs will cover topics such as menstrual hygiene management, hand washing, access to clean water, and the importance of maintaining good personal hygiene. Through engaging and informative radio broadcasts, the project seeks to empower young girls with the knowledge and skills necessary to adopt healthy hygiene habits that will promote their well-being. 
The project aims to address the critical issue of female sanitation and hygiene awareness in Liberia through targeted radio programs. Liberia faces challenges in promoting proper hygiene practices among females, leading to health issues according to the World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), and Liberia Ministry of Education give their expertise on public health, child welfare, and educational policies related to sanitation, hygiene, and adolescent health in Liberia. This project seeks to leverage the influential medium of radio to disseminate essential information and foster behavioral change regarding female sanitation and hygiene. However, the lack of adequate information on sanitation and hygiene practices among females poses significant health risks among young females in Liberia. In response, this project proposes the development and implementation of radio programs aimed at raising awareness and promoting better sanitation and hygiene practices among high school female students in Liberia.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particularly in Africa, developing countries, LDCs, and SIDS",PARTICIPAT.

Radio Program on Early Childhood Development and Education in Liberia,"Despite the recognized importance of early childhood development and education, there is a lack of widespread awareness and accessible information on best practices and resources for parents, caregivers, and communities in Liberia. Many families, especially in remote or rural areas, may not have access to formal early childhood education programs or may not be fully informed about the critical role they play in fostering their child’s cognitive, social, and emotional development. This gap in knowledge and resources poses a risk to the overall well-being and future success of Liberian children. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a targeted radio program that focuses on raising awareness, providing practical information, and promoting effective strategies for early childhood development and education, ensuring that all children in Liberia have the opportunity to thrive and reach their full potential.

TOT Workshops on the Preventions and Awareness of HIV/AIDS and Coronavirus for ASPnet Students and UNESCO Club Members,"Since there is no cure for either HIV/AIDS or coronavirus, preventive and awareness information should always be made available . Despite the information that there have been efforts to address HIV &amp; AIDS and Coronavirus awareness in Liberia, there is a critical need for targeted interventions among ASPnet Students and UNESCO Club Members. These groups may lack comprehensive knowledge about preventive measures, transmission modes, and the importance of early detection for both HIV &amp; AIDS and Coronavirus. Additionally, socio-cultural factors, stigma, and misinformation may contribute to the vulnerability of these populations. The overlapping risks and preventive strategies for HIV &amp; AIDS and Coronavirus further emphasize the importance of a combined awareness workshop. Therefore, there is an urgent need to conduct workshops that specifically target ASPnet Students and UNESCO Club Members, providing them with accurate information, dispelling myths, and empowering them with the knowledge and skills necessary to protect themselves and their communities from both HIV &amp; AIDS and Coronavirus. Moreover, HIV &amp; AIDS and Coronavirus Prevention and Awareness Workshops for ASPnet Students and UNESCO Club Members in Liberia would typically outline the key issues that the workshop aims to address. In this case, the workshop would focus on highlighting the challenges and gaps in knowledge or awareness regarding HIV &amp; AIDS and coronavirus among ASPnet students and UNESCO club members in Liberia.

The absence of platforms like book fairs hinders the promotion of literacy, critical thinking, and intellectual growth. This gap not only affects individual development but also has broader implications for education, social cohesion, and cultural enrichment. Therefore, there is a pressing need to organize and promote book fairs as a means to encourage reading, improve access to a variety of literature, and cultivate a thriving reading society in Liberia. Moreover, Promoting Reading Society through Book Fairs in Liberia” revolves around the need to address the low literacy rates and lack of reading culture in Liberia.

IMPROVING THE  ENROLMENT  OF  FEMALE   SAHO  CHILDREN  THROUGH MOBILIZING THE SAHO COMMUNITY.,"Southern Region is one of the densely populated regions of the country (Eritrea). Currently, it has about 800,000 population. It is one of the regions which share common boundary with Ethiopia. Large portion of the population in the region is affected by the 1998-2000 war of aggression, which was waged by the Tigray regime that resulted in the displacement of about 38 Schools with 22,202 students and 372 teachers.  The Tigray claimed some parts of these sub regions. School Facilities were pillaged by the Tigray military force.  
Although virtual demarcation had been given by the Hague, there had been skirmishes until 2022. As a result, there is feeling of trauma in the children.  There is a need of helping the people in general and the children in particular.
The economic activities of the region are predominantly agricultural with a very limited semi-pastoralism in the lowland areas.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particularly in Africa, developing countries, LDCs, and SIDS",PARTICIPAT.

Start Them Right,"The experiences children have in early childhood shape the brain and the child’s capacity to learn, get along with others and respond to daily stresses and challenges. Research has shown that readiness for primary school, which includes a child’s behaviour, readiness to learn, social and emotional skills, early literacy, and early numeracy are important skills to include on a school readiness tool as these skills had the most predictive validity for later school success. (Duncan,2007)
Early Intervention services are essential to ensure children&#39;s success. However, making a referral is only the first step. It&#39;s important to recognize that parents may face various obstacles, such as financial constraints, confusion, or discouragement, which may hinder them from following through with the process. Even if a referral is made, not all evaluations lead to services. Nonetheless, every child can benefit from some form of developmental support, and doctors&#39; offices play a critical role in facilitating this. By making referrals and following up on them, we can ensure that children receive the services they need to thrive and reach their full potential. Science has proven how best to support children&#39;s development, but accessibility is key. Making referrals and following up on them is a crucial step toward ensuring that every child has access to these services. The ultimate goal of facilitating this kind of fair is to provide an opportunity for children to access services that can positively change the trajectory of their learning outcomes. The organization of the referral fair is grounded in the concept of that of a Health Fair but specifically designed for children who may have special needs. 
Therefore, The Early Childhood Commission, under the Theme Start Them Right, seeks to partner with child developmental specialists with the hopes of facilitating a diagnostic process. This will cater to the children showing delays in their learning or development. These children&#39;s records will be extracted from the from the ECC’s secondary-level screening tool data, Ages and Stages Questionnaire-Jamaica (ASQ-J). The Ages and Stages Questionnaire Jamaica is a development assessment tool that has been implemented in screening and referral pathways worldwide. It is designed to monitor a child’s developmental progress and identify children with potential developmental delays. It is used to further screen children who have been identified as “at risk” by the Jamaica School Readiness Assessment. Hence, the ASQ-J is a secondary screening tool which is used to pinpoint specific areas of risk so that interventions can be more targeted.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particularly in Africa, developing countries, LDCs, and SIDS",PARTICIPAT.

"CHAMP (Child, Home and Mentorship Project)","Jamaica has made significant strides towards attaining the Sustainable Development Goals. In spite of these achievements, the country is still challenged by socio-economic development issues which range weak economic performance, poor student outcomes and high rates of violent crime. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the academic performance of male students, introducing challenges such as disruptions to traditional learning environments and increased disparities in access to educational resources. Addressing these effects is crucial for ensuring equitable academic outcomes for male students during these unprecedented times.

The “Project” is a programme of mentorship and guidance, to support boys as they remain in school and work towards academic and professional goals.  The “Project” is designed to encourage Jamaican students, age 13-18 years old, and selected secondary school students to complete their education. The programme presents strategies which have the potential to make a difference to learning, motivation and engagement in schooling, and consequently to raise levels of academic achievement; personal and socio-economic development. 

To this end, the potential exists for the creation of employment and other opportunities to enhance the life chances of youth. This proposal outlines the CHAMP Project that will engage youth from low income households to develop critical thinking skills and offer them opportunities to promote sustainable development in Jamaica.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particularly in Africa, developing countries, LDCs, and SIDS",PARTICIPAT.

A more cognizant youth practicing sustainability, thereby protecting the island and themselves and their futures. 

Phase 2 for this recycling initiative, focuses on the setting up a small-scale plastic recycling workplace for which specific machinery is necessary.  There are different types of machines for the different outputs envisioned. It mainly comes down to a shredder which shreds the plastics to small ‘malleable’ pieces, an injector which melts the pieces which can then be injected into small molds for smaller plastic items, an extruder which works similar to an injector but is there to create bigger items through bigger molds (think a keychain vs a beam for a bench), and a sheet press which melts down plastic pieces into big slabs (generally 1x1m – think: table tops etc.).","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particularly in Africa, developing countries, LDCs, and SIDS",PARTICIPAT.

Design of Flagship Program on Education for Peace,"At its 220 session, the Director-general has proposed to the Executive Board of UNESCO to launch a new flagship program on Education for Peace that will seek to safeguard and valorise UNESCO’s longstanding efforts to build the defences of peace through education by providing a set of global standards to support countries in implementing education for peace, while upholding the institutions, norms and standards that secure human rights and the dignity of all women and men.

The implementation of the program will be supported by a reinforced central team at UNESCO Headquarters and a network of regional and national/country-based officers.

The objective is to strengthen the safety of students and teaching staff by providing decision-makers, both at the Ministries of Education and Civil Protection Authorities (and the different national or local authorities), with tools and information to take science-based decisions on where and how to invest their available resources.  This will be accomplished by ensuring that the risk to communities is communicated in an easy, simple, effective and accessible manner.

Improvement of the legal framework in the field of tangible cultural heritage of Uzbekistan,"The special status of cultural heritage objects as a unique value of the people of Uzbekistan and an integral part of the world cultural heritage requires a comprehensive and integrated approach to the legal regulation of relations concerning their protection, management, administration and preservation.
Current legislation seems powerless to resolve a number of fundamental issues related to the functioning of certain objects of cultural heritage and their status at the regional legal level (for example, problems of coordination of the actions of numerous specialized agencies, correlation of private interests and their public burdens with respect to preservation and use of historical and cultural monuments, etc.). Thus, it is obvious that in order to effectively implement the existing regulatory framework in the field of cultural heritage it is required to make certain changes in the regulatory framework that correspond to the actual situation.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particul",PARTICIPAT.

"6th National Meeting of Schools Associated with UNESCO ""Education for Development: Sustainability at School""","The world today lacks committed people who contribute to the well-being of all and the achievement of sustainable development. This change can be driven by education, as it sensitizes, raises awareness, and shapes behaviours.

The pursuit of sustainable development requires the involvement of school managers, teachers, and families for the materialization of the SDGs and, especially, in the exercise of the right to quality education. It should be noted that Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) is recognized in the SDGs of the UN 2030 Agenda as part of target 4.7 of SDG 4, when it expresses that by 2030: 

ensure that all students acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to promote sustainable development, including but not limited to through education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles, human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture of peace and non-violence, global citizenship, and appreciation of cultural diversity and culture&#39;s contribution to sustainable development.&quot; (UNITED NATIONS, 2015).

In Angola, the regulations that govern the Education and Teaching System, within its purposes, guarantee &quot;To train an individual capable of understanding national, regional and international problems in a critical, constructive and innovative way for their active participation in society, (...)&quot;, (LBSEE, 17/16, article no. 4, paragraph c), which demonstrates the social responsibility and commitment that Educational Institutions have with the development of current and future generations.

Under the motto &quot;The future begins with education&quot; and the central theme &quot;Education for sustainable development at school (Target 4.7)&quot;, the 6th National Meeting of Schools Associated with UNESCO will be held from 4 to 5 October, whose general objective is to provide education agents with theoretical assumptions about Education for Sustainable Development.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particul",PARTICIPAT.

Start Them Right,"The experiences children have in early childhood shape the brain and the child’s capacity to learn, get along with others and respond to daily stresses and challenges. Research has shown that readiness for primary school, which includes a child’s behaviour, readiness to learn, social and emotional skills, early literacy, and early numeracy are important skills to include on a school readiness tool as these skills had the most predictive validity for later school success. (Duncan,2007)
Early Intervention services are essential to ensure children&#39;s success. However, making a referral is only the first step. It&#39;s important to recognize that parents may face various obstacles, such as financial constraints, confusion, or discouragement, which may hinder them from following through with the process. Even if a referral is made, not all evaluations lead to services. Nonetheless, every child can benefit from some form of developmental support, and doctors&#39; offices play a critical role in facilitating this. By making referrals and following up on them, we can ensure that children receive the services they need to thrive and reach their full potential. Science has proven how best to support children&#39;s development, but accessibility is key. Making referrals and following up on them is a crucial step toward ensuring that every child has access to these services. The ultimate goal of facilitating this kind of fair is to provide an opportunity for children to access services that can positively change the trajectory of their learning outcomes. The organization of the referral fair is grounded in the concept of that of a Health Fair but specifically designed for children who may have special needs. 
Therefore, The Early Childhood Commission, under the Theme Start Them Right, seeks to partner with child developmental specialists with the hopes of facilitating a diagnostic process. This will cater to the children showing delays in their learning or development. These children&#39;s records will be extracted from the from the ECC’s secondary-level screening tool data, Ages and Stages Questionnaire-Jamaica (ASQ-J). The Ages and Stages Questionnaire Jamaica is a development assessment tool that has been implemented in screening and referral pathways worldwide. It is designed to monitor a child’s developmental progress and identify children with potential developmental delays. It is used to further screen children who have been identified as “at risk” by the Jamaica School Readiness Assessment. Hence, the ASQ-J is a secondary screening tool which is used to pinpoint specific areas of risk so that interventions can be more targeted.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particul",PARTICIPAT.

"CHAMP (Child, Home and Mentorship Project)","Jamaica has made significant strides towards attaining the Sustainable Development Goals. In spite of these achievements, the country is still challenged by socio-economic development issues which range weak economic performance, poor student outcomes and high rates of violent crime. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the academic performance of male students, introducing challenges such as disruptions to traditional learning environments and increased disparities in access to educational resources. Addressing these effects is crucial for ensuring equitable academic outcomes for male students during these unprecedented times.

The “Project” is a programme of mentorship and guidance, to support boys as they remain in school and work towards academic and professional goals.  The “Project” is designed to encourage Jamaican students, age 13-18 years old, and selected secondary school students to complete their education. The programme presents strategies which have the potential to make a difference to learning, motivation and engagement in schooling, and consequently to raise levels of academic achievement; personal and socio-economic development. 

To this end, the potential exists for the creation of employment and other opportunities to enhance the life chances of youth. This proposal outlines the CHAMP Project that will engage youth from low income households to develop critical thinking skills and offer them opportunities to promote sustainable development in Jamaica.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particul",PARTICIPAT.

Girls in Tech: Transforming Futures of Palestinian girls and invest in closing the digital divide between adolescent boys and girls and ensure girls are provided equal opportunities to excel in STEM fields.,"Palestinian women alongside with men have made significant contributions across various sectors including their role in socio- economic development and family and community life. However, women and girls continue to face entrenched discrimination and rights violations. 

In Education, Palestinian women have made meaningful progresses. Literacy rates for women have improved significantly, and women exceeded the number of men in Palestinian universities. As for the percentage of female students enrolled in Palestinian higher education institutions, it reached 62% out of the total number of students enrolled in higher education institutions in 2021-2022, of whom about 10% are enrolled in the ICT major, (59% among males, and 41% among females), and about 3% are enrolled in natural sciences, mathematics and statistics (28% among males, and 72% among females).  However, there remains a gap in translating education into workforce participation. The unemployment rate among women participating in the labor force was about 40% compared to 20% among men in 2022.  Those who do work often face wage gaps and limited opportunities in leadership positions. Women are more likely to work in education, healthcare, and informal sectors.

This intervention will focus on building the capacity of adolescent girls in West Bank in applying digital technologies for the resilience and development of their communities, while nurturing their well-being and promoting their personal and professional development. In particular, the activity is developed to support school students, mainly girls, in creating digital solutions to address women's and girls' equal rights and empowerment using coding, robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) through project-based learning and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education approaches.   


Project Goal
This initiative aims to inspire and support adolescents (80% girls, 20% boys) to embark on a learning journey to be capable of contributing to re-building and re-shaping their communities, their personnel development and their futures. Through the project, students will develop their 21st century, digital technology and innovation skills that can help them gain and create employment while fostering more resilient and sustainable communities by addressing such issues and challenges related to human rights, livelihood, health issues and climate change.

Since the culture and heritage are a very sensitive and dynamic area, policy preparation to satisfy all stakeholders is a challenge. Therefore, this workshop will be designed as a three-day residential workshop and includes consultation sessions with the participation of relevant stakeholders in the public sector, private sector and NGO sector. It is expected to have around 40 participants for the workshop.
Facilitation of the reputed resource person who has both national and international experience on making cultural and heritage policy will be taken to conduct the workshop. Especially his experiences and active participation in UNESCO, will be an additional valuve for success for the task. During the workshop, the first draft of the national policy document will be done and shared among all stakeholders to obtain their comments and opinion. As the final output of the project there will be a policy document for the culture and heritage sector in Sri Lanka.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particularly in Africa, developing countries, LDCs, and SIDS",PARTICIPAT.

"Empowerment of Ugandan Youth Networks and Organizations for Youth-Led Gender-responsive Climate Actions, Research and Development","The Youth Committee of the Uganda National Commission for UNESCO (UNATCOM) established in 2010, has been concerned about the low level of awareness of the youth of Uganda about UNESCO and its programmes designed to empower the youth. Disappointingly, the level of knowledge is not only very low, but even of all the various youth organizations that exist countrywide, only two are associated with UNESCO. These two are UNESCO clubs, one in Gulu University, an upcountry city location and the second at Nakawa Vocational Training College, in Kampala Metropolitan City. This number is too low compared to the situation in the other East African countries such as Rwanda which has 35 UNESCO Clubs and Kenya with 168 UNESCO Clubs and Associations. This is despite the fact that there are many concerns affecting Ugandan youth to address relating to 38.5% of young people aged 10-19 that live in the poorest wealth quintiles, 80% of Uganda’s youth that living  in rural areas and one out of four young people aged 10-24 years residing in urban areas have no means for self-empowerment, 19.6% of young people aged 10-19 years living  in households where the head of household has no education, 22% of adolescents aged 13-18 years dropping out of school while 8.8 million young people aged 15-24 years not engaged in education, employment or under any training1.
Though a National Youth Council Act, 1993 exists, it specifically provides for a National Youth Council which is largely political with no stated focus on the social challenges faced by the youth. There is Uganda Youth Network (UYONET) that purports to be a leading national youth organization working to mainstream young peoples’ engagement in development and governance processes in Uganda and East Africa. This network started in 2002 to respond to the increasing demand for a collective platform for research, training and policy advocacy for young people by young people. However, it does not address the concerns of interest to UNESCO. Statistics indicate  that the youth in Uganda have continued to face multitudes of problems namely: Teenage pregnancy (25% of teenage girls in Uganda age 15-19 have had a child or are pregnant), Health risk behaviors (22% of adolescents have ever had sexual intercourse and  10% of  sexually active adolescents aged 15-19 years had their first sexual encounter before age 15), Child Marriage (10% of women aged 20-24 years married by age 15),  Gender-Based Violence ( 60% of adolescents 10-19 years have experienced physical violence, 42% emotional violence and 10% sexual violence), HIV/AIDS (Every year 9,600 young people aged 15- 19 years are newly infected with HIV)2.  A Cross Sectional Survey Study conducted by scholars show that alcohol, substance use and psychosocial competence of adolescents in selected Secondary Schools in Uganda was at 70% 3.

Grâce à une gouvernance ouverte entre la République du Tchad et l’UNESCO, la réserve de biosphère de Sena-Oura a été créée et est la première réserve de biosphère du Tchad. Elle couvre une surface totale de 173 520 ha constituant les derniers vestiges intacts de la savane soudanaise du pays et abrite des éléphants, des Elans de Derby et des girafes. Grâce à la profusion de terres fertiles et aux conditions agro climatiques favorables, l’agriculture traditionnelle et l’élevage du bétail en particulier assurent la subsistance de près de 90 % de la population. La sylviculture joue également un rôle important dans l’économie locale, avec la production de produits très prisés comme le miel et l’huile de karité.
Afin de reconnaître le rôle majeur que jouent les réserves de biosphère pour l’ensemble de la zone de Sena-Oura, l’Association des Jeunes pour l’Assainissement et la Protection de l’Environnement (AJAPE), une ONG nationale partenaire à l’UNESCO en collaboration avec le Ministère de l’Environnement, de la Pêche et du Développement Durable compte organiser des campagnes d’information et de sensibilisation, en faveur des populations (jeunes, femmes, chefs de village, chefs de canton, autorités locales…).

Le Burkina Faso, à l’instar des autres pays de la région du Sahel traverse une crise sécuritaire difficile marquée par des attaques terroristes qui affectent beaucoup le système éducatif.

Au nombre des écoles fermées figurent les écoles associées à l’UNESCO.

Workshop on Climate Change and Sustainable Development,"Despite efforts to promote sustainable development, Liberia remains highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The country’s long coastline and reliance on agriculture make it particularly susceptible to sea-level rise, storm surges, and changing rainfall patterns. These impacts pose significant challenges to the country’s development goals, including efforts to reduce poverty and promote economic growth. Moreover, it is proven that Liberia is facing numerous challenges related to climate change and sustainable development, including increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events, deforestation, and limited access to clean water and energy, there is a lack of widespread awareness and capacity at the community level to address these issues effectively. Communities often lack the knowledge, resources, and support needed to develop and implement climate-resilient strategies and sustainable development practices. Additionally, there may be a disconnection between national policies and local priorities, hindering coordinated action at the grassroots level. Consequently, there is an urgent need to empower communities with the tools, information, and skills necessary to adapt to climate change, mitigate its impacts, and promote sustainable development practices that enhance resilience and improve livelihoods across Liberia.
To address some of these challenges, there is a need to build climate resilience and promote sustainable development at the community level. Community-based strategies can help to ensure that interventions are tailored to local needs and realities, while also empowering communities to take action to adapt to climate change and build resilience. However, there are significant barriers to implementing such strategies in Liberia, including limited resources, capacity gaps, and a lack of awareness and understanding of climate change issues among communities.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particularly in Africa, developing countries, LDCs, and SIDS",PARTICIPAT.

Improving Literacy and Numeracy at the Kindergarten Level,"Division of Public Education’s focus is to strengthen the quality of the education that we offer to our students. In doing so, it is the intention to focus on the earlier age groups specifically the kindergarten year 1 and 2 classes. This is where formal education begins for most children entering the public schools, as most of the students who are enrolled in Public Education do not attend preschool (1-3 years).  Our kindergarten classes begin with the kindergarten 1- or the 4-year old’s and then the student moves on into the second year of kindergarten, or the 5- years old’s.  

The focus is to restructure the teaching instruction for this group. In doing, so it is essential to have the early childhood material which will allow the teachers to work more effectively with these students.  The expectation is not only to see that the students are academically ready, but to also see that they have developed socially and emotionally as well. Therefore, the early childhood materials purchased must be aligned with the learning standards and teaching objectives of our curriculum.  The materials should reflect diverse backgrounds, and the learning styles of students.  It is the belief that the students will be successful learners in the long run because a solid foundation for learning has been developed for these young children. 

Research shows that high-quality learning resources can boost student engagement, motivation, and comprehension.  Research also shows that if kindergarten children can explore while learning during play, it helps to stimulate their creativity and higher thinking skills.  They will not be passive learners but will be actively engaged in their daily learning activities. This is what we would like to achieve with our students. We are hoping that with this grant we can enhance our kindergarten classrooms and make them more conducive for learning.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particularly in Africa, developing countries, LDCs, and SIDS",PARTICIPAT.

Creación y Conformación del Comite Nacional del MOST Paraguay,"El objetivo de este proyecto es la instalación del Comité Nacional del MOST en Paraguay.

A lo largo de los años, el Consejo Intergubernamental del Programa MOST ha subrayado el papel crucial Comités Nacionales y el valor de su contribución, destacando la importancia de mantenerlos en el contexto específico de cada país. Se alienta a los Estados Miembros de la UNESCO a establecer un comité nacional para alcanzar los objetivos del Programa MOST y, en particular, para desarrollar las capacidades nacionales en el área de las ciencias sociales.

El objetivo fundamental de un Comité Nacional MOST es el de fortalecer las capacidades nacionales de investigación en ciencias sociales (1), a fin de contribuir en el logro de las prioridades nacionales, y fomentar el vínculo entre la investigación social y los actores políticos que trabajan en el sector del desarrollo social.

Para cumplir con las formalidades necesarias, se inscribiría el Comité Nacional MOST Paraguay, en el Consejo Intergubernamental (CIG) del Programa de Gestión de las Transformaciones Sociales (MOST).

Los Comités Nacionales tienen la misión de lograr los objetivos del Programa MOST a nivel país. Persiguen los mismos objetivos, pero cada comité nacional tiene sus propias prioridades.

En el caso paraguayo, el desarrollo de las ciencias sociales, ha logrado avances en la última década como la creación de la Facultad de Ciencias Sociales en la Universidad Nacional de Asunción, el desarrollo de investigaciones y el apoyo a investigadores a través de programas del Consejo Nacional de Ciencias y Tecnología (CONACYT), la posibilidad de realizar cursos de postgrado en universidades extranjeras a través del Programa de Becas Carlos Antonio López (BECAL). La creación de universidades públicas y privadas en diferentes partes del país.

A pesar de estos avances todavía se necesita en el país un mayor impulso en el campo de la investigación, la difusión de los resultados y la utilización de los mismos en la formulación de las políticas públicas. Las políticas no siempre dialogan con las ciencias sociales y en ocasiones, a pesar de contar con datos e informes provenientes de investigaciones, estos no son aprovechados para el diseño y el mejoramiento de las políticas públicas, los planes y programas.

Además, Paraguay requiere mayor comunicación e intercambio con grupos académicos y e investigadores y centros académicos a nivel regional e internacional.

A partir de la instalación del Comité Nacional MOST, se elaborará una Agenda de Trabajo, con reuniones mensuales, observando las problemáticas sociales y coyunturales del país.","Enabling Outcome 10 - Reinforced partnerships, outreach and advocacy in support of UNESCO’s action","10.PPF1 - Participation Programme management significantly improved allowing greater transparency, timely coordination among sectors and responsiveness, and an increase in the number of projects approved for gender equality and countries in need, particularly in Africa, developing countries, LDCs, and SIDS",PARTICIPAT.
